# Interactive auth flow for Gemini CLI in the e2e harness (issue #77).
#
# Populates ~/.crewrig-e2e/gemini/{oauth_creds.json,settings.json} by running
# `gemini` inside a TTY-attached container; the developer picks "Login with
# Google" and completes the browser flow on the host. Subsequent scenario
# runs mount the same dir read-only.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run on an already-authenticated dir. The CLI skips
# the login menu when oauth_creds.json carries a valid refresh token.
#
# See docs/adr/0002-e2e-auth-flow.md (Decision 3) for the full rationale.
