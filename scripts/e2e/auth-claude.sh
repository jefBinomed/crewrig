# Interactive auth flow for Claude Code in the e2e harness (issue #77).
#
# Populates ~/.crewrig-e2e/claude/{.credentials.json,.claude.json} by running
# `claude /login` inside a TTY-attached container with the host dir bind-mounted
# read-write. The dedicated test account is used; the developer completes the
# OAuth browser flow on the host. Subsequent scenario runs mount the same dir
# read-only.
#
# Rules directory: regardless of the auth backend, this script populates
# ~/.crewrig-e2e/claude/rules/ by copying ~/.claude/rules/*.md from the host.
# The 01-layered-context scenario mounts that directory as /home/agent/.claude
# inside the container. Running `task setup:claude` (or the interactive
# equivalent) first is a prerequisite.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run on an already-authenticated dir. Existing
# credential files are preserved by claude itself (it skips the login prompt if
# the session is still valid). Rules files are always refreshed from the host.
#
# See docs/adr/0002-e2e-auth-flow.md (Decision 2) for the full rationale.
