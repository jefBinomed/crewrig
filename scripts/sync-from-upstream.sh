#!/bin/bash
# sync-from-upstream.sh — Pull core-layer files from the canonical upstream.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/sync-from-upstream.sh
#
# Reads the upstream URL from crewrig.config.toml (canonical_repo field).
#
# Policy-driven (spec 0020). Each .crewrig/core-paths.txt entry carries one
# of four policies (default `strict` when the column is absent):
#
#   strict         Upstream-owned. A local modification relative to FETCH_HEAD
#                  aborts the sync — revert or promote the change to overlay
#                  before syncing.
#   adopt-on-edit  Upstream-owned until the adopter diverges, then frozen
#                  permanently. The "modified?" decision is stateless and
#                  two-tier (committed marker fast path, then upstream-history
#                  membership). Never aborts the sync.
#   regenerable    Upstream-owned content the component build regenerates
#                  (spec 0199 R42) — today, the four compiled agent output
#                  trees. Restores exactly as `strict` restores, including
#                  the spec-0064 orphan cleanup, but NEVER aborts on a local
#                  divergence: under an organization-level model-mapping
#                  override the divergence is the build's own correct
#                  output, and this script cannot run the build to tell the
#                  two apart. Each restored member whose local content had
#                  diverged is reported on stdout.
#   excluded       Org-owned. Never guarded, never restored, never touched.
#
# An `excluded` entry nested under a `strict`/`adopt-on-edit`/`regenerable`
# parent (e.g. `specs/org` under `specs`, `.crewrig/.synced-markers` under
# `.crewrig`, `model-mappings/*.org.yml` under `model-mappings`) is
# carved out of BOTH the parent's dirty guard and its restore via a
# `:(exclude)` git pathspec — so org content under a core parent can neither
# abort the sync nor be overwritten.
#
# On success, restores each eligible core-layer path from FETCH_HEAD into the
# working tree without staging or committing anything. Review the diff with
# 'git diff' before deciding what to commit.
#
# --preserve-history (opt-in, spec 0086; default OFF):
#
#   bash scripts/sync-from-upstream.sh --preserve-history
#
# Enabling this flag is always an explicit, per-invocation operator choice —
# it defaults to off and is never enabled implicitly by crewrig.config.toml,
# an environment variable, or any other mechanism. After the policy-aware
# restore above completes without aborting, this mode additionally records
# the fetched upstream commit (FETCH_HEAD) as a real ancestor of the current
# branch: it creates a single commit whose tree is byte-identical to what the
# restore alone produced and whose second parent is FETCH_HEAD, so later
# history-inspection commands (`git log`, `git merge-base`, `git bisect`)
# surface the upstream lineage directly. That one commit inherits the
# repository's own commit.gpgsign setting (spec 0122): it is signed wherever
# an ordinary `git commit` in that repository would be. Three failure modes
# apply only in this mode:
#
#   - Shallow-clone refusal: exits non-zero before any fetch, restore, or
#     commit when the local repository is a shallow clone. This is a
#     separate guard from the IS_SHALLOW check further below, which governs
#     `adopt-on-edit` directory reconciliation only and is unaffected by
#     `--preserve-history`.
#   - Anti-pollution guard: aborts the history-preserving step (without
#     committing, leaving the already-restored files in the working tree) if
#     the working tree carries an uncommitted change outside the governed set
#     — every `strict`/`adopt-on-edit`/`regenerable` manifest entry, minus
#     any nested `excluded` child — plus the .crewrig/.synced-markers/
#     bookkeeping directory.
#   - Signing refusal: aborts the history-preserving step (same posture as
#     the anti-pollution guard — no commit, branch tip unmoved, restored
#     files left in the working tree) when the repository is configured to
#     sign commits but the signature cannot be determined or produced.
#     Degrading to an unsigned commit is never an accepted outcome.
#
# When FETCH_HEAD is already an ancestor of the current branch tip, the mode
# is a no-op: no commit is created and the script exits zero.
#
# Requires git >= 1.9 (the `:(exclude)` magic pathspec).
