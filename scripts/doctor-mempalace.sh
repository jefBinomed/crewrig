#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/doctor-mempalace.sh — Report which MemPalace will actually answer on
# this machine, and flag any divergence (spec 0108 R7-R10).
#
# Three questions, three labelled sections, all derived from what resolves at
# the moment of invocation — never from an enumeration of known Python package
# managers (R9). A MemPalace placed by a mechanism the framework has never heard
# of is reported like any other.
#
#   1. "What a session actually launches" — for each of the four CLI MCP
#      registration files, the wrapper and interpreter the argv actually names,
#      the checkout that wrapper lives in, the pin that checkout declares, and
#      the version that interpreter serves. The discriminator is the
#      concatenation `[.command] + .args`, NOT a position inside `.args`: some
#      registrations put the interpreter in `.command` with the wrapper as
#      args[0], others put `bash` in `.command` with the tls-exec.sh wrapper and
#      the interpreter inside `.args`.
#   2. "What resolves on your PATH" — for each of `mempalace` and
#      `mempalace-mcp`, the resolved path, its realpath, the interpreter read
#      from its shebang (through a `#!/bin/sh` polyglot wrapper when the venv
#      path contains a space — issue #1417), and the version that interpreter
#      serves.
#   3. "What a fresh setup would select" — the ordered interpreter candidate
#      list, the winner, and an explicit line when the winner is not the
#      highest-priority candidate (R10). This is what the NEXT setup run would
#      pick; it is not what any running session uses.
#
# This script only ever READS. It mutates no install and no CLI config, per the
# spec's "the diagnostic reports; it does not mutate" scope boundary.
#
# Exit status (R8): non-zero when any two reported versions differ, when any
# reported version lies outside the pin it was checked against, or when any two
# reported pins differ. A GUARD ABSENT / UNGUARDED label is reported loudly but
# is not on its own a non-zero condition — a pre-guard checkout is the expected
# state on every machine until setup is re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/doctor-mempalace.sh
#   task mempalace:doctor

# -e intentionally omitted: this is an aggregating diagnostic. Every probe is
# allowed to fail and be reported; the accumulated verdict controls the exit.
