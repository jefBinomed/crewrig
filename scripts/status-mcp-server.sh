#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/status-mcp-server.sh — Report the state of the shared MemPalace MCP
# HTTP daemon (spec 0113 R10, R16; ADR 0016).
#
# Exit 0 → serving and healthy. Exit 1 → not serving, or serving unsafely.
#
# This script is the operator's ONLY window onto three things that have no
# other surface once sessions stop launching their own memory server:
#
#   1. The spec-0108 runtime version guard. Its refusal relies on "the
#      launching CLI reports a failed memory server" — after the switch there
#      is no launching CLI, so a non-healthy verdict tails the daemon log here.
#   2. Whether authentication is actually ON. A daemon started without a token
#      serves every request unauthenticated while looking perfectly healthy;
#      an unauthenticated probe of /mcp must be REFUSED. /healthz cannot answer
#      this — it is served with require_auth=False and returns 200 in every
#      state, including the broken one.
#   3. Launcher drift. The installed launcher lives outside the repository and
#      a `git pull` does not update it, so it records the hash of the source it
#      was built from and we compare that against the source now.

# `127.999.0.1`, would go through DNS and could leave the machine, so the
