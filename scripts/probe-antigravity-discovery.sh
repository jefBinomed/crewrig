#!/bin/bash
# probe-antigravity-discovery.sh — re-establish which locations Antigravity CLI
# discovers, for each component kind and each on-disk shape (spec 0123 R13/R14).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Spec 0123 was written because the framework installed skills
# where the assistant never looks, and the mistake was made by reading the
# vendor's documentation instead of observing the assistant. The vendor guide
# lists `~/.gemini/config/` as the only machine-local customization root and does
# not mention `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` at all — yet agents ARE discovered
# from the latter. Documentation-only reasoning got that half wrong. R13 keeps
# the observation re-runnable so the record can be re-established rather than
# trusted, and R14 makes a transient non-answer distinguishable from an absence.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. Installs uniquely-named sentinels across the candidate discovery
# locations x component kinds x on-disk shapes, then asks `agy` twice per kind:
#   1. an OPEN listing  — `agy -p "list your skills"` / `agy agents`;
#   2. a FORCED-CHOICE prompt — one `<name>=YES|NO` line per sentinel, plus a
#      real installed component as a positive control.
# The forced-choice shape is what makes R14's third verdict possible: a sentinel
# with no `<name>=` line in the answer is a NON-ANSWER, not an absence. An open
# listing cannot tell those apart, and reading omission as absence is exactly the
# error R14 exists to prevent — it was made once on this ticket already.
#
# THE DUPLICATE-NAME CELL. One agent name is installed at TWO proven agent roots
# simultaneously. Every sentinel in the first probe was uniquely named, so
# nothing observed said whether a duplicate shadows, doubles, or is refused — and
# the framework's own fix creates that condition, since `harness-curator` is
# shipped as a library agent and `~/.gemini/agents/harness-curator.md` already
# exists on any machine that ran the Gemini setup.
#
# NOT A CI GATE. Spec 0123 -> "Out of scope" rules out automated enforcement of
# the discovery claim: this needs the vendor binary, a model-driven session and
# minutes of wall time. It is invoked deliberately by a human or an agent. The
# CLASSIFIER, however, is hermetically tested — see
# scripts/tests/test-antigravity-discovery-probe.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/probe-antigravity-discovery.sh
#
# Environment seams:
#   AGY_BIN               — the vendor binary (default `agy`). Stubbed by the test.
#   AGY_PROBE_TIMEOUT     — per-call bound in seconds (default 300). The bound must
#                           exceed the two-minute hang it exists to survive, so the
#                           hermetic test overrides it rather than burning that long.
#   AGY_PROBE_ASK_SHAPE   — `captured` (default) or `direct`. Test seam, and the
#                           reason it exists is in probe_ask() below: the two call
#                           shapes have DIFFERENT `set -e` behaviour on the timeout
#                           path, and both must stay covered.
#
# Exit status:
#   0 — every sentinel classified FOUND or NOT-FOUND
#   1 — precondition failure (missing binary, a sentinel name already on disk)
#   3 — at least one sentinel classified INDETERMINATE (R14's third verdict)

# --- The bounded call --------------------------------------------------------
#
# FOUR TRAPS SIT ON THIS FUNCTION, all of them measured on Bash 3.2.57:
#
# 1. `kill "$pid"` reaches the backgrounded WRAPPER, not the process it forked.
#    A timed-out `agy` therefore outlives the EXIT trap that removes the
#    sentinels, and keeps reading them. `set -m` gives the job its own process
#    group and `kill -TERM -- "-$pid"` takes the whole tree down.
# 2. `wait "$pid"` on a job the watchdog killed returns 143. Reaching `set -e`
#    at top level, that ABORTS the script — losing the classification before
#    INDETERMINATE can be recorded.
# 3. The same `wait`, inside a command substitution (`ans="$(probe_ask ...)"`),
#    completes and returns 0 instead. That is not safety, it is blindness: a
#    bare `false` in the same position would pass just as silently.
#
# `wait "$pid" || st=$?` closes all three: the status is captured deliberately
# and branched on, and never reaches `set -e` in either call shape.
#
# 4. `set -m` itself warns ("cannot enable job control in this shell") on some
#    non-interactive Docker shells (issue #1215) and, under this script's own
#    `set -euo pipefail`, a build where it returned non-zero would abort the
#    whole probe right here — before the bounded command even starts. Both
#    calls are therefore guarded with `2>/dev/null || true`: the warning never
#    reaches the operator and a non-zero return can never trip `-e`.
#
#    That guard is a courtesy, not a functional fallback, and the surrounding
#    code is NOT correct when job control genuinely fails to enable: a
#    background job's pgid only diverges from the launching shell's once `-m`
#    is active (verified directly), so without it `"$@" &` and the watchdog
#    stay in THIS shell's own process group, `kill -TERM -- "-$pid"` targets a
#    process group nothing leads, and the signal silently matches zero
#    processes (already `2>/dev/null`). The bound then degrades to "wait for
#    the command to exit on its own" — trap 1 above stops being closed, and a
#    hung `agy` outlives the timeout instead of being killed by it. This
#    ticket (#1215) scopes to silencing the spurious warning; re-deriving a
#    watchdog that still works without job control is tracked separately in
#    issue #1222.
