# check-skill-versions.sh — Enforce the version-bump rule on component sources.
#
# Per artifacts/FORMAT.md → Version semantics, every PR that touches
# a skill, command, or agent source under artifacts/core/, artifacts/library/, or
# artifacts/community/ MUST bump `metadata.provenance.version` in the same
# diff. This script enforces the rule.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-skill-versions.sh [<base-ref>]
#
# Default base ref: probes remotes for crewrig or origin, falls back to the
# first available remote, then prefers /main, falling back to /develop when
# the reference remote carries no main branch (issue #1214). CI passes
# BASE_REF env var pointing at the PR's *target* branch (`base.ref` in GitHub
# Actions context) — NOT the PR's source/head branch. The guard diffs the PR
# against what it's about to merge into, so changes that haven't yet
# landed in the base are subject to the bump rule. A BASE_REF ending in `/`
# (an unexpanded CI variable) is normalized to unset rather than handed to
# git verbatim — see scripts/lib/base-ref-resolve.sh.
#
# Exits 0 if all changed sources include a version bump, non-zero (with a
# per-file failure list) otherwise.
