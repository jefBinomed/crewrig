# reserve-spec-id.sh — Secure a spec id on the reference repository before the
# spec file exists (spec 0112, and its delta-01 for the org corpus).
#
# The failure this removes is not a lint error but a misdirected one: two
# sessions picking up two tickets in the same second both compute
# `max(existing) + 1`, both get the same number, and the collision surfaces in
# an unrelated third pull request after both specs have merged — by which time
# the id is carried by an issue, a branch name, a PR title and a logbook.
#
# THE MECHANISM. A reservation is a PARENTLESS git object pushed to a ref under
# the configured namespace, with the id as the ref's last component and the
# ticket in the object's commit message. The guarantee is the remote's
# create-only compare-and-swap, requested with `--force-with-lease=<ref>:` (an
# empty expected value means "this ref must still not exist"): in a true race
# exactly one push lands and the loser is REFUSED. Parentlessness closes the
# distinct sequential path in which a latecomer's *descendant* object would
# satisfy the ordinary fast-forward rule and overwrite a live reservation —
# measured: a plain, leaseless push of a descendant to an occupied reservation
# ref succeeds.
#
# THE ALLOCATED SET, for the upstream corpus, is the union of three sources:
#   - the ids merged on `<remote>/main` outside `specs/org/`;
#   - `refs/spec-ids/*`;
#   - `refs/tags/spec-id/*`.
# Both upstream carriers are read on every run regardless of which one is
# configured for writing, so a repository that changes its carrier keeps a
# complete allocated set across the transition. Org reservations are NOT read
# into that union (spec 0112 delta-01, replaced requirement 3): they live in a
# SIBLING namespace, never a child, because an `ls-remote` pattern's `*` crosses
# `/` and a nested `refs/spec-ids/org/<ID>` would be returned by a read of
# `refs/spec-ids/*`.
#
# WHICH NAMESPACE IS WRITTEN is named by the tracked, repository-scoped setting
# `.crewrig/spec-id-carrier` — identical for every contributor by construction,
# never inferred at runtime, never persisted by this script, and never switched
# automatically under any circumstance. Two contributors writing into two
# different namespaces both succeed and both hold the same id, which is exactly
# what a per-contributor environment variable produces; hence the setting is a
# pull request, not an export.
#
# WHICH CORPUS an identifier belongs to is TOLD, never inferred from the
# identifier's shape. Inferring it would require upstream to recognise an org
# numbering convention, which spec 0112 delta-01 requirement 16 forbids and
# `specs/0071-org-specs-lint-exclusion.md` deliberately prevented.
#
# WHICH REMOTE is resolved from the reference branch, with the idiom this
# repository already has rather than a third one: `BASE_REF` when set, else the
# first remote matching `crewrig|origin` (falling back to the first remote at
# all) with `/main` appended — the derivation documented at
# `scripts/lib/spec-linter.js:114-131`, which aligns itself with
# `scripts/check-skill-versions.sh:24-33` for exactly this reason. The remote is
# the ref's first path component, so it is always a remote NAME: no repository
# path and no URL is hardcoded anywhere here, which is what lets the regression
# suites point the tool at a `file://` bare repository.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/reserve-spec-id.sh --issue <N>
#   bash scripts/reserve-spec-id.sh --id <ID> --issue <N> [--corpus upstream|org]
#   bash scripts/reserve-spec-id.sh --help
#
# Exit contract — authoritative:
#
#   0   The id is secured on the remote.       stdout: the id.
#   3   The id is allocated LOCALLY and NOT secured — offline, unreachable
#       remote, no write access (the fork case), or a namespace the remote
#       refuses. stdout: the id, then `unsecured-id: true`.
#   1   Genuine failure — malformed `/specs/` state, an invalid carrier value,
#       a non-representable identifier, `--corpus org` without `--id`, an
#       identifier already held by a different ticket, or a retry budget
#       exhausted by lost races. stdout: nothing; the reason is on stderr.
#
# The first stdout line is ALWAYS the id, on exit 0 and exit 3 alike. The second
# line on exit 3 is the unsecured marker, emitted in the EXACT form the spec
# frontmatter takes — `unsecured-id: true`, the optional field
# `docs/spec-format.md` defines — so the caller pastes it rather than composing
# it. The exit code already carries the boolean, so nothing programmatic depends
# on this line's separator.
#
# This script EMITS; it never writes a spec file. Requirement 2 places
# allocation before the spec file exists, so `spec-author` consumes exit 3 and
# writes the mark at file-creation time.

reserve-spec-id.sh — secure a spec id before the spec file exists (spec 0112).

  bash scripts/reserve-spec-id.sh --issue <N>
      Allocate and secure the next free UPSTREAM id.

  bash scripts/reserve-spec-id.sh --id <ID> --issue <N> [--corpus upstream|org]
      Secure one specific identifier, treated as an opaque string. Both the
      maintainer path of requirement 10 (securing a fork contribution's id
      before merge) and, generalised from <NNNN> to any string, requirement 14
      of delta-01.

Options:
  --issue <N>   GitHub issue the id is reserved for. Required.
  --id <ID>     Secure this identifier instead of computing the next free one.
                Required with --corpus org.
  --corpus <c>  'upstream' (default) or 'org'. Explicit, never inferred from
                the identifier's shape.
  --offline     Skip the remote entirely and return exit 3.
  -h, --help    This block.

There is deliberately no --remote flag: the remote comes from the reference
branch, resolved with the repository's existing BASE_REF idiom below.

Environment:
  BASE_REF                       The reference branch. Default: the first
                                 remote matching 'crewrig|origin' (else the
                                 first remote) with /main appended. The remote
                                 is its first path component.
  CREWRIG_SPEC_ID_CARRIER        One-off carrier override for a single
                                 invocation, for debugging. NOT the normal
                                 configuration route — see
                                 .crewrig/spec-id-carrier.
  CREWRIG_SPEC_ID_MAX_ATTEMPTS   Retry budget for lost races (default 10).
  CREWRIG_REPO_DIR               Repository root override (used by the
                                 regression suite).

Exit codes: 0 secured (stdout: the id) | 3 allocated locally, NOT secured
(stdout: the id, then 'unsecured-id: true') | 1 genuine failure (stderr).
