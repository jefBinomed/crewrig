# check-extension-version-bump.sh — Enforce the version-bump rule on UPSTREAM
# extension skill/agent sources (spec 0044, R2/R3/R4).
#
# Mirrors scripts/check-skill-versions.sh, but for extension components. The
# artifacts guard greps the diff for an *added* `version:` frontmatter line;
# that primitive is WRONG for extension components because, per spec 0043, their
# `version` rides on an HTML-comment carrier (the first body line), not in
# frontmatter (Gemini 0.42.0+ rejects non-name/description frontmatter keys on
# in-place sources). So this guard parses the carrier on BOTH sides and compares
# the actual version VALUES — a bump is `new != old`, not "a version: line was
# added". The carrier parser is the shared scripts/lib/provenance-carrier.sh,
# the same one check-extension-provenance.sh uses, so the two guards cannot drift.
#
# Scope — upstream-owned tiers only (extensions/core, extensions/library), and
# skills/agents only. Commands carry no provenance/version per spec 0043, and
# extensions/org is adopter-owned (consistent with the sibling guards).
#
# Diff model — like check-skill-versions.sh:
#   - status A (added)    → new component, EXEMPT (R3); starts at 1.0.0.
#   - status M (modified) → subject to the bump rule (R2).
#   - status D (deleted)  → skipped.
#
# Per-modified-component decision (R4 / F2 — three OLD-side branches made
# explicit so a future reader does not collapse "absent carrier" and
# "empty version" into one path):
#   1. NEW-side carrier absent OR version empty       → hard FAIL.
#        Every upstream extension component MUST carry a non-empty version per
#        spec 0043; a missing/empty NEW carrier is corruption or a stripped bump.
#   2. OLD-side carrier WHOLLY absent (no crewrig-provenance first body line at
#      all on the BASE ref)                            → EXEMPT.
#        The component pre-dates the 0043 carrier; this very modification is the
#        one that gives it a carrier — there is nothing to bump *from*.
#   3. OLD-side carrier present but version field empty/missing → hard FAIL.
#        A real corruption or a no-bump masquerading as newly-provenance'd; do
#        NOT silently exempt it (distinct from branch 2).
#   4. Otherwise compare values: new == old → FAIL (no bump); new != old → OK.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-extension-version-bump.sh [<base-ref>]
#
# Default base ref mirrors check-skill-versions.sh: probe remotes for crewrig or
# origin, fall back to the first remote, then prefer /main, falling back to
# /develop when the reference remote carries no main branch (issue #1214). CI
# passes BASE_REF env pointing at the PR's *target* branch. A BASE_REF ending
# in `/` (an unexpanded CI variable) is normalized to unset rather than handed
# to git verbatim — see scripts/lib/base-ref-resolve.sh.
#
# Exits 0 if all modified extension sources include a version bump (or are
# exempt), non-zero (with a per-file failure list) otherwise.
