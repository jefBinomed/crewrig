# test-mcp-daemon.sh — Regression tests for the shared MemPalace MCP HTTP
# daemon (spec 0113, ADR 0016).
#
# ISOLATION CONTRACT — read this before adding a case.
#
# Every test that touches supervisor or daemon state isolates on ALL THREE
# axes, and refuses to run if any of them resolves to its production value:
#
#   1. label / unit name  — a shared label lets a test act on the operator's
#                           real supervisor unit; launchd labels are keyed by
#                           uid (gui/<uid>) and `systemctl --user` units too,
#                           so $HOME alone does not isolate them.
#   2. PORT               — the axis that matters most here and the one a
#                           label guard does not watch. This tier is reached
#                           over HTTP: a correctly test-labelled unit that
#                           fails to bind because production holds the socket
#                           leaves the clients connecting to PRODUCTION. The
#                           writes then land in the operator's real palace with
#                           every assertion passing — green and destructive at
#                           once.
#   3. $HOME              — keeps the palace, the lock filename and the token
#                           path off the real store.
#
# The same contract is documented at test-chroma-server.sh:19-21.

# Be precise about what these two constants do, because the guard below reads
# as though they protect the operator and they do not: the port override is
# unconditional, so the effective port is always drawn from 18000-18899 and
# can never equal either constant. Both clauses are therefore UNREACHABLE as
# the file stands. They are kept as a tripwire on the override itself — weaken
# it to `${VAR:-default}` or drop it, and an operator who exports a production
# port reaches the tests with the guard already in place to catch them. What
# protects a pre-#748 machine today is the override, not this comparison.

# may serve on any port at all. Refuse rather than re-roll, per this file's
# contract. No emptiness test is needed beside it: unset leaves this empty and
# the override is always non-empty, so the comparison is simply false. And do
# NOT extend this to refuse merely because the captured value is a production
# port — exporting 8021 is how a pre-#748 machine is configured, the override
# already makes such a machine safe, and refusing there would skip the tests

# Reintroduction guard: no credential may travel through an argv flag either —
# not the hand-built header, and not curl's own credential flags, which end up
# in the same place. /proc/<pid>/cmdline is world-readable on Linux, so a local
# uid sampling the process table while a probe runs harvests the credential —
# the reason both probes feed the header through a stdin curl config instead
# (scripts/lib/common.sh `_mcp_daemon_probe_accepts`, and `_probe_code` in
# section 16 below). BOTH halves of the banned string — the header name and
# the scheme word — are concatenated at runtime (`argv_hdr`, `argv_scheme`) so
# THIS assertion cannot satisfy the search it performs. Splitting the scheme
# alone sufficed while the search was case-sensitive; it does not since spec
# 0149 R1 made the match case-insensitive, because any line in this block that
# spells the header name out then self-trips the pattern. It deliberately
# admits every spelling of the flag rather than the canonical one only:
# `--header` as well as `-H`, `=` or nothing in place of the space
# (`--header=`, `-H'…'`, `-HAuthorization:…`), an optional opening quote, and
# anything at all between the colon and the scheme name — a cold review put
# all four variants past the earlier `-(H|-header) ` form untouched.
# Over-matching is the right failure direction here: a false positive costs a
# reader one glance, a false negative ships the credential back into the
# process table.
#
# Comments are stripped by matching grep -n's own `<line>:` prefix ANCHORED
# (spec 0149 R2), NOT by leading whitespace — the trap section 4 below
# documents — and NOT unanchored, which used to swallow any genuine violation
# whose line merely carried a trailing comment. The anchor is why the sweep
# runs ONE FILE AT A TIME: hand `grep -n` two paths and every hit gains a
# `<path>:` prefix, so `^[0-9]` never matches and the filter degenerates into
# excluding nothing. The filter is load-bearing either way, since common.sh's
# `register_mempalace_mcp` explains the hazard in prose that quotes the very
# flag being banned.
#
# Scope: the three files this spec governs, swept through the same helper as
# the fixture below — the executable witness that every shape the pattern
# claims to catch is caught, that a pure comment is still excluded, and that
# the swept paths were actually read. hooks/mempalace-transcript.sh joined the
# swept set alongside scripts/lib/common.sh and this file itself (issue #1247,
# cold-review finding i1-F2): it carried this exact pattern via curl -H until
# that ticket moved it to a `-K -` stdin config, and a static guard belongs
# next to the dynamic argv-stub test (test-mempalace-transcript-hook.sh) that
# already exercises the same regression on that file. The one deliberate
# occurrence in the repository, scripts/tests/test-setup-org-mcp.sh, asserts
# the org-MCP argv shape on purpose and carries a comment saying so at its own
# call site (spec 0149 R4); no other occurrence exists under scripts/ or

# Behavioural half: probed skip on the prerequisites the launcher actually
# needs, mirroring section 10 — CI has no mempalace venv, so quote the reason
# rather than silently passing.
#
# BOTH prerequisites, not just the import. mcp-daemon-launcher.sh's
# CHROMA_WAIT_SECONDS loop waits on ChromaDB and `die`s when it stays
# unreachable for MEMPALACE_MCP_CHROMA_WAIT, which this suite pins to 2s
# above — so a developer with mempalace installed and Chroma stopped used to
# get "the daemon never became healthy" and a red suite for a missing
# prerequisite, which is the opposite of the clean skip R4 claims. The probe
# below is that loop's own, verbatim (same endpoint, same --max-time), so it
# tests exactly what the launcher is about to test — the same reasoning
# _wait_bindable records for the port preflight.
#
# Scenario 2 (specs/0139) assumes an ALREADY-LOADED supervisor unit; that
# precondition is structurally untestable here — install_daemon_supervisor
# reads config/launchd/${label}.plist and no plist ships for a randomised
# test label (com.mempalace.mcp-server-test-$$). This half instead asserts
# the property scenario 2 demands — the running process gets replaced and the
# superseded token stops being honoured — without the supervisor precondition:
# it covers the process-replacement EFFECT, not the launchd-unit STATE. The
# "replace" step below is therefore kill-and-relaunch, not launchctl/systemctl:
# with no unit loaded there is no supervisor path to exercise, and naming it
# here keeps the next reader from looking for a launchctl path that isn't

# --- 18. Bearer token never reaches jq's argv (#1247) ------------------------
# register_mempalace_mcp and restore_mempalace_registration used to pass the
# token to jq via --arg/--argjson, which lands on jq's own argv — world-
# readable via /proc/<pid>/cmdline on Linux. They now deliver it through
# $ENV.<VAR> instead, reading a same-command env-var prefix assignment. Stub
# jq to log every invocation's full argv (quoting-safe: a loop over "$@", not
# "$*", so an embedded space in one argument cannot be mistaken for a second
# one) and prove the token substring never appears there — then, with the
# real jq restored, prove the configs were actually written (so the argv
# guard cannot pass merely because a write silently failed).
