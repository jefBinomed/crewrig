# generate-github-golden.sh — Regenerate github-releaserc.golden.json from the
# PRE-REFACTOR release driver (spec 0213 PLAN v2 test 10c, as amended by the
# plan review's named edit v2-F1).
#
# The golden is the `.releaserc.json` that `main`'s own heredoc wrote before
# the release driver was refactored into scripts/lib/monorepo-release-lib.sh.
# It cannot be written by hand or extracted from the heredoc text: the heredoc
# bakes four run-time values into the JSON (the branch, the extension name,
# and the absolute repository root and release-output paths). So this script
# RUNS the historical driver, unmodified, in a throwaway fixture checkout:
#
#   - extension `foo` (extensions/core/foo/package.json), branch `main`;
#   - `npx` is shadowed by a shim that copies the `.releaserc.json` the driver
#     wrote into the current extension directory, then exits 0 (no engine);
#   - every occurrence of the fixture's absolute root is replaced, as a
#     literal string (jq split/join, never a regex), by the fixed placeholder
#     `/ROOT`, so the golden is machine-independent while keeping its bytes.
#
# test-monorepo-release.sh then compares, with `jq -S .`, this golden against
#   emit_releaserc github publish foo /ROOT /ROOT/dist/release/foo main
#
# Usage (from the repository root):
#   bash scripts/tests/fixtures/release/generate-github-golden.sh [<ref>] \
#     > scripts/tests/fixtures/release/github-releaserc.golden.json
#
# <ref> defaults to bbd6cf6, the last `main` commit whose
# scripts/monorepo-release.sh still carried the heredoc — the one that already
# loads semantic-release-gitmoji through its ESM facade (issue #1225), so the
# golden is the config whose note R21 freezes. It must name a commit of that
# shape; the script refuses when the driver it runs writes no config.
