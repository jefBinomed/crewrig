# test-reserve-spec-id.sh — Regression tests for reserve-spec-id.sh (spec 0112
# and its delta-01, issue #726).
#
# Every case runs against a LOCAL BARE REPOSITORY under a temporary directory.
# No network, no forge command-line tool, no reliance on crewrig/crewrig. Each
# fixture is self-contained and torn down with the temporary root.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Invocation surface — settled by the coordinator, binding on this suite and on
# the implementation alike
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Spec 0112 and PLAN v9 pin the tool's BEHAVIOUR and its exit codes but not the
# spelling of its surface. That gap was closed by an explicit five-point ruling
# during DEV; what follows is that ruling, and this suite tests it rather than
# whatever the implementation happens to do.

#                    Org siblings derived:  refs/spec-ids-org/ , refs/tags/spec-id-org/

#                                           invocation, validated on the same
#                                           closed pair (PLAN step 4). The
#                                           CREWRIG_ prefix is this repository's
#                                           established convention —
#                                           CREWRIG_REPO_DIR, CREWRIG_GITLAB_HOSTS,
#                                           CREWRIG_TEST_*.
#
#   Reference remote Resolved by NAME, never by a flag and never hard-coded:
#                    the first remote matching `crewrig|origin`, else the first
#                    remote at all. This is the existing repository idiom
#                    (the `getRemoteName` function in scripts/lib/spec-linter.js,
#                    aligned with the remote resolution block in
#                    scripts/check-skill-versions.sh "so the repository has
#                    one idiom rather than two"). Fixtures carry both a `crewrig`
#                    and an `origin` remote; Case 23 covers the fallback arm.
#
#   Reservation      A parentless object whose message is, verbatim per PLAN
#                    step 1, `reserve <ID> for issue #<N>`.
#
# Exit contract under test (PLAN step 2, authoritative):
#   0  secured on the remote        stdout: the id
#   3  allocated, NOT secured       stdout: the id on line 1, then exactly
#                                   `unsecured-id: true` on line 2
#   1  genuine failure              stdout: nothing; reason on stderr
#
# `unsecured-id` is one name across two surfaces — this stdout marker and the
# optional frontmatter field docs/spec-format.md gains — and the colon form
# makes the two surfaces identical in syntax as well as in name: line 2 is
# already a valid frontmatter line, so `spec-author` transcribes it rather than
# reformatting it on the one code path that runs with no human present to catch
# a bad rewrite. Line 1 is a bare id with no key, so stdout was never uniformly
# `key=value` and nothing is lost by not being parseable as such.
#
# Asserted exactly, and by line number, rather than by a loose match on
# `unsecured`: the shape is a contract with a declared consumer, so a change to
# it must be a visible test failure rather than a silent drift.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One harness rule that is load-bearing, not stylistic
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Namespace-separation assertions use `git ls-remote <bare> '<pattern>'`, never
# `git -C <bare> for-each-ref '<pattern>'`. The two do NOT agree, and the
# disagreement is precisely the defect PLAN v9 was revised to close. Measured on
# git 2.55.0 against one repository holding both refs:
#
#   git ls-remote    o 'refs/spec-ids/*'  → refs/spec-ids/0112
#                                           refs/spec-ids/org/ORG-0001   ← returned
#   git for-each-ref   'refs/spec-ids/*'  → refs/spec-ids/0112           ← NOT returned
#
# `ls-remote` is what the tool itself performs, and its `*` crosses `/`; a nested
# org namespace therefore lands inside the upstream read. `for-each-ref` matches
# path-wise and would hide exactly that. A future tidy-up of `remote_ls` into
# `for-each-ref` would leave Cases 6, 7, 14 and 16 green against an
# implementation that had reintroduced `refs/spec-ids/org/<ID>`. Use
# `server_refs` (full, unfiltered, immune to hideRefs) only for "nothing was
# pushed" assertions.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What continuous integration proves about reserve-spec-id.sh: nothing
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# No CI job runs the tool. It is invoked by a human or by `spec-author` at
# pickup time, before a branch exists, so no pipeline is in a position to
# exercise it and none tries. THIS SUITE is the only automated thing that does,
# and a green pipeline says only that the suite ran.
#
# The sibling guard has the sharper version of the same trap, recorded in
# scripts/tests/test-check-spec-id-reserved.sh: check-spec-id-reserved DOES run
# in CI, and exits early and successfully whenever the change adds no spec file
# — most pull requests, including the one that introduced it. A green badge
# there reports that the check ran, not that it discriminated.
#
# Both belong next to the two rules below. All three are the same hazard —
# something is green for a reason other than the one a reader will assume — and
# the badge version is the most dangerous, because a badge carries more
# authority than a comment.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A green shellcheck is necessary and NOT sufficient for this file
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An editing pass once left seven argument lines orphaned in command position,
# where they executed on every run. shellcheck flagged TWO of them (SC2287) and
# could not see the other five, which differed only in their contents. Removing
# the two it named silenced the linter while five stray commands kept running —
# the detector went quiet and the behaviour did not change, which is worse than
# the original defect because it manufactures evidence of correctness.
#
# The suite reported 78/0 throughout: a stray command fails, nothing consumes
# its status, and execution continues.
#
# So the check that actually works here is execution, not analysis:
#
#   LC_ALL=C bash scripts/tests/test-reserve-spec-id.sh 2>&1 \
#     | grep -c "command not found"      # MUST be 0
#
# Run that after any edit to this file. It is the fourth member of the family
# above and the sharpest instance of it, because here the false evidence came
# from a tool whose whole purpose is to supply true evidence.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-reserve-spec-id.sh

# forgotten argument, a bad value, a misconfigured setting — and each asserts
# the identifying content that makes the message actionable rather than the

# Deliberately not covered, and this is a judgement rather than an oversight:
# the CREWRIG_SPEC_ID_MAX_ATTEMPTS validations and the empty-identifier guard,
# which need an env var a user rarely sets or an argument they cannot easily
# type; and the retry-exhaustion refusal, which is not reachable hermetically
# at all — it needs a real competitor winning every round, and every substitute
# collapses into a different branch. Covering the first two would be assertions
# for their own sake; the third is a known gap, reported rather than faked.
