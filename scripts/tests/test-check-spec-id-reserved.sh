# test-check-spec-id-reserved.sh — Regression tests for check-spec-id-reserved.sh
# (spec 0112 requirements 7, 10, 11 as amended by delta-01, issue #726).
#
# Every case runs against a LOCAL BARE REPOSITORY under a temporary directory.
# No network, no forge command-line tool, no reliance on crewrig/crewrig. Each
# fixture is self-contained and torn down with the temporary root.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Invocation surface assumed by this suite
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   scripts/check-spec-id-reserved.sh          no arguments; a CI check
#
#   Base of the change    BASE_REF, the name spec 0109 established and that
#                         .github/workflows/build.yml already passes three times.
#   Pull-request origin   Two pairs, either of which determines the origin. The
#                         CrewRig pair is consulted first, the GitLab pair
#                         second; both unset is the undeterminable case.
#
#                           CREWRIG_PR_HEAD_REPO / CREWRIG_PR_BASE_REPO
#                             GitHub Actions. .github/workflows/build.yml maps
#                             github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name and
#                             github.repository into these. They are NOT named
#                             GITHUB_*: GitHub reserves that prefix, so such a
#                             name would be fragile in the very `env:` block
#                             that has to set it — and there is no native
#                             head-repo variable to mirror anyway, since
#                             GITHUB_HEAD_REF is the branch, not the repository.
#                             A name that reads as native while being something
#                             GitHub does not publish is a trap for whoever
#                             maintains this next.
#
#                           CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_PROJECT_PATH / CI_PROJECT_PATH
#                             GitLab CI, where both are already ambient. These
#                             are the only origin variables PLAN v9 step 11 pins
#                             verbatim.
#   Reference remote      Fixtures carry BOTH a `crewrig` and an `origin` remote
#                         pointing at the same bare repository.
#
#   Reservation record    A parentless object at refs/spec-ids/<ID> or
#                         refs/tags/spec-id/<ID> whose message is, verbatim per
#                         PLAN step 1, `reserve <ID> for issue #<N>`.
#
# Verdicts: exit 0 = the pull request may proceed (including the cases the check
# reports on without blocking); non-zero = the check fails the pipeline. PLAN v9
# pins no particular non-zero value, so this suite asserts the distinction and
# not a numeral.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One harness rule that is load-bearing, not stylistic
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Namespace reads use `git ls-remote <bare> '<pattern>'`, never
# `git -C <bare> for-each-ref '<pattern>'`. Measured on git 2.55.0, `ls-remote`
# returns `refs/spec-ids/org/ORG-0001` for the pattern `refs/spec-ids/*` while
# `for-each-ref` does not — the `*` of a refspec crosses `/`. Case 5 depends on
# that distinction to catch a nested org namespace; rewriting it with
# `for-each-ref` would leave it green against the defect it exists to find.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What a green `check-spec-id-reserved` job in CI does and does not prove
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# It does not prove the guard works. The check exits early, successfully, when
# the change under test adds or renames no spec file — which is most pull
# requests, including the one that introduced the guard itself. A green badge on
# such a run reports that the check RAN, not that it discriminated: it never
# reached a candidate, never read a reservation, and never took a branch this
# suite covers.
#
# That is the same green-for-the-wrong-reason hazard the two rules below guard
# against, arriving in the CI job rather than in a test, and it is the more
# dangerous of the three because a badge carries more authority than a comment.
# THIS SUITE is what exercises the guard, by constructing the repositories the
# early exit means CI will rarely present. Read a green job as "no spec entered
# the corpus here" and a green suite as "the guard discriminates".

# The unsecured-id mark (requirement 9) and its removal (requirement 10)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The mark is the reservation tool's OUTPUT and this check's INPUT, and nothing
# in PLAN v9 drew the line between them — which is how the invariant in the
# `unsecured-id` row of the frontmatter schema table, "a merged spec never
# carries it", reached `main` enforced by nothing. The linter type-checks the boolean; this check compared
# holder against ticket and logged OK without ever reading the mark.
#
# One case is not enough here, and the reason is structural rather than
# rhetorical. Each of the three below was checked against the wrong fix it is
# supposed to catch, and one of them does NOT catch what it first appeared to:
#
#   Case 13  the headline. Removing the stale-mark enforcement fails this and
#            nothing else.
#   Case 14  catches a mark enforced OUTSIDE the blocking gate — a bare `exit`
#            or `wiring_fault` on the mark's presence, which is the natural way
#            to write "this must never merge" and which bypasses origin
#            discrimination entirely, blocking the fork path the mark exists to
#            serve. It does NOT catch a mark merely routed to `add_finding`
#            unconditionally: that respects the BLOCKING flag, so a fork still
#            exits 0 and this case stays green. Routing through `add_finding`
#            rather than around it is the property being pinned.
#   Case 15  catches the opposite over-correction, where the mark is read as
#            "the author already knows" and a blocking condition is downgraded
#            to a report — which would let a same-repository author opt out of
#            the guard by pasting one line.

# Case 13 — the stale mark. The id IS secured, for this spec's own ticket, so
# the run would otherwise be the golden path of Case 1. Requirement 10 says the
# mark is removed in the same act that secures the id; a spec that keeps it has
# a frontmatter field asserting the opposite of the reservation record, and
# merging it puts a permanent falsehood in the corpus.

#
# The defect these were written for: the GitLab job set no base, the script fell

# Case 16 — the defect itself. A merge request onto `release/1.x`, in a GitLab
