# test-setup-antigravity-transcript.sh — Regression tests for Antigravity CLI
# transcript-hook activation (spec 0116, issue #724).
#
# Unit under test: deploy_antigravity_transcript_hooks() in scripts/lib/common.sh,
# plus the shipped manifest hooks/antigravity-transcript-hooks.json.
#
# WHY A HELPER AND NOT THE SETUP SCRIPT. The three sibling setups inline their
# transcript blocks, but `test-setup-mcp-merge.sh` records the house rule that
# the interactive scripts cannot run end-to-end in CI (fzf prompts, the `agy`
# guard, the chroma daemon). Spec 0116 R17 demands hermetic coverage of the
# deployment, so the deployment lives in a helper the test can call and the two
# `fzf` prompts are asserted structurally instead (§4).
#
# Contract asserted (spec 0116, incl. delta-03):
#   R1/R2 — the manifest is a map of NAMED hooks and registers only events the
#     CLI actually has. The four names spec 0056 shipped
#     (BeforeAgent/AfterTool/AfterModel/SessionEnd) do not exist and MUST be absent.
#   R3 (delta-01 as rescoped by delta-03) — `Stop` is the ONLY event registered
#     under the named hook `crewrig-mempalace-transcript`, because it is the only
#     one that fires once per turn. Measured, agy 1.0.16, one turn with three
#     shell commands: PreInvocation 4x, PostInvocation 4x, PreToolUse 3x, Stop 1x.
#     The manifest MAY carry OTHER named hooks with their own normative base —
#     namely `crewrig-worktree-git-guard`, whose `PreToolUse` registration is
#     covered by R27 below.
#   R27 (delta-03) — the manifest carries `crewrig-worktree-git-guard` registering
#     `PreToolUse` through a group whose `matcher` selects `run_command` and whose
#     handler command names `hooks/worktree-git-guard.sh`.
#   R28 (delta-03) — the deployment rewrites the guard command to the absolute
#     REPOSITORY path of `hooks/worktree-git-guard.sh` — never the installed
#     transcript hook, no env prefix, no lifecycle-event argument.
#   R22 (delta-01) — the consent text states the true per-turn write volume.
#   R24 (delta-01) — the setup script's call-site ARGUMENTS are asserted, not just
#     that the deployment is reached. An emptied env prefix silently disables
#     recording, and previously survived the whole suite.
#   R4 — no command depends on the launch directory ($PWD is fatal here: a
#     handler's cwd is the directory holding hooks.json, not any project).
#   R5 — every command registered under the transcript hook tells the hook which
#     event fired, because the Antigravity payload carries no event name. The
#     guard command is exempt (it reads the payload it receives on stdin).
#   R13/R14 — the hook script is installed under the assistant's own directory
#     and every transcript command names it by absolute path, with the enabling
#     env prefix.
#   R15 — an existing manifest is backed up before being touched, and a hook the
#     operator already declares survives the merge.
#   R16 — asserted structurally: both decline paths reach neither the helper nor
#     any write.
#
# HERMETIC: no HOME writes, no network, no interactive script runs. Every
# deployment targets throwaway paths under a temp root removed on exit.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-setup-antigravity-transcript.sh

# -e intentionally omitted: the pass/fail counters drive the harness, and some
# probes (jq -e presence checks) return non-zero on purpose.
