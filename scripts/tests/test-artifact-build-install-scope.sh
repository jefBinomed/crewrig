# test-artifact-build-install-scope.sh — Regression tests for spec 0019
# (artifact build/install scope; ADR-0011).
#
# Pins three behaviors the spec mandates:
#
#   Scenario 1 — An `org` component builds, and installs into the user home
#                only when the org tier is opted in (build + install halves).
#   Scenario 2 — A newly-added tier directory is compiled with no edit to
#                build-components.sh (tier-agnostic build, R1/R3).
#   Scenario 3 — A `community` component is compiled but is NOT placed in the
#                user home (nor the project tree) without opt-in.
#
# Strategy:
#   * Build routing is exercised by running the REAL build-components.sh
#     against a throwaway REPO_DIR seeded with synthetic artifact tiers.
#     Nothing touches the real repo tree or the real dist/.
#   * Install mechanics are exercised by extracting the REAL
#     `install_tier_to_home` function body verbatim from the shipped
#     setup-claude-interactive.sh and calling it against a temp HOME. This
#     tests the production code path, not a re-implementation.
#   * The opt-in *gate* (fzf-driven) is not directly callable; its invariant
#     contract is verified structurally (see the gate test + the gap note at
#     the foot of this file).
#
# Hermetic: every artifact lives under a mktemp -d work area removed on EXIT.
# After this script runs, `git status --porcelain` MUST stay empty.
