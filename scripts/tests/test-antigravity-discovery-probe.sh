#!/bin/bash
# test-antigravity-discovery-probe.sh — Regression tests for the discovery
# probe's R14 classifier and its bounded call (spec 0123, issue #761).
#
# Unit under test: scripts/probe-antigravity-discovery.sh, with `AGY_BIN`
# stubbed and `AGY_PROBE_TIMEOUT` set small.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE SPAWNS WHERE ITS SIBLING SOURCES. The probe carries top-level
# logic and cannot be sourced, so it must be spawned — and the bounded wait,
# whose Bash 3.2 behaviour this suite is the only runtime detector of, lives
# exactly there. Every spawn therefore uses `"${BASH:-bash}" "$SUBJECT"`, never
# a bare `bash`: a bare spawn would develop and verify this code at 5.3 while
# the harness banner printed 3.2, which is the failure mode
# `scripts/tests/test-component-tier-resolution.sh` shows at :318 (banner)
# against :437 (bare spawn). Measured across the suite directory: 0 of 68 suites
# propagate the interpreter to their subjects. This one does; sweeping the rest
# belongs to issue #798.
#
# THE PROBE ITSELF CANNOT RUN IN CI — it needs the vendor binary, a model-driven
# session and minutes of wall time, which spec 0123 -> "Out of scope" rules out.
# Its CLASSIFIER is what lands here, and that is hermetic.
#
# Contract asserted (spec 0123):
#   R13 — the procedure is re-runnable: it refuses to start on a name collision
#         and restores the pre-run tree exactly, including directories it did
#         NOT create.
#   R14 — three verdicts, and INDETERMINATE is distinct from NOT-FOUND in both
#         message and exit status. A sentinel with no answer line, an empty
#         answer, and a call that exceeds the bound are all INDETERMINATE.
#   Plus: nothing survives the bounded-out case — the only assertion that can
#         see a `kill` that reaches the wrapper instead of its process group.
#
# HERMETIC: `HOME` and `AGY_BIN` both point into a temp root. No `agy`, no
# network, no writes to the real home.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-antigravity-discovery-probe.sh

# -e intentionally omitted: the counters drive the harness and most runs of the
# subject are expected to exit non-zero.
