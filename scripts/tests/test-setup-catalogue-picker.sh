# test-setup-catalogue-picker.sh — Regression tests for the shared
# team/expertise/level catalogue picker (spec 0096, issue #603).
#
# Unit under test: pick_catalogue_entry() in scripts/lib/common.sh, driven
# through its hermetic surface (an empty fixture catalogue directory, and a
# stubbed `fzf` on PATH). The genuine interactive fzf UI is out of scope for
# an automated test, matching this repo's convention (see
# scripts/tests/test-setup-validation-backend.sh house style).
#
# Contract asserted (spec 0096):
#   R1  zero *.md files under a catalogue dir -> zero candidates offered to
#       fzf, no literal `*`/`*.md` placeholder, and fzf is never invoked at
#       all (nullglob short-circuit).
#   R2  an empty result (empty catalogue OR declined pick) lets the caller
#       continue rather than terminate the script.
#   R3  a skip removes any stale marker file from an earlier run.
#   R4  the message printed distinguishes an empty catalogue from a declined
#       pick, naming the affected category in both cases.
#   R5/R6 identical behavior across all three categories and all four
#       in-scope setup scripts — asserted structurally (no leftover
#       `exit 1` inside any team/expertise/level block, and a matching
#       `rm -f .../.selected_<category>` skip branch at all 12 call sites).
#   R7  functional smoke test: an empty catalogue lets a real setup script's
#       selection sequence continue past the skipped step.
#
# HERMETIC: every operation runs against mktemp -d fixtures; nothing under
# the real repo's config/ directories or the real user's CLI home is read or
# written. PATH is temporarily prefixed with a directory holding stub
# binaries (fzf) for the calls that need one; the prefix is removed on exit.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-setup-catalogue-picker.sh

# -e intentionally omitted: pass/fail counters control the harness, and some
# probes intentionally check a non-zero/empty result.

#   - config/teams/     -> zero *.md files (the empty-catalogue path, R1/R2)

#     reached and completed the THIRD category, i.e. it was never aborted)
# then asserts a marker placed immediately after the extracted block was
# reached, rather than only asserting the absence of the 'exit 1' string.
