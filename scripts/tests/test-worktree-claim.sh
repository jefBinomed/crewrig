# test-worktree-claim.sh — Regression tests for worktree-claim.sh (spec 0114,
# issue #736).
#
# Every case runs against a self-contained fixture repository under `mktemp -d`,
# with its own main checkout and its own linked worktree. Nothing here reads or
# writes the repository the suite ships in. That is not politeness: cases 9 and
# 13 run `git clean -fdx` and `git reset --hard`, which are the exact operations
# spec 0114 exists to contain, and a suite that ran them against its own checkout
# would be the incident it tests for.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Fixture layout is load-bearing, not incidental
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   $TMP_ROOT/<case>/real/repo                     main checkout
#   $TMP_ROOT/<case>/real/repo/.worktrees/736      linked worktree (the subject)
#   $TMP_ROOT/<case>/link -> $TMP_ROOT/<case>/real symlink, for case 12 only
#
# The worktree MUST sit under a `.worktrees/` path component. The four mutating
# subcommands (`run`, `take`, `release`, `takeover`) refuse with exit 1 when the
# toplevel is not under one, so a fixture that puts the worktree anywhere else
# fails every case for a reason that has nothing to do with the behaviour under
# test.
#
# The fixture commits a `.gitignore` carrying `.worktrees/`, so its main checkout
# stays clean while holding the worktree inside itself.
#
# That is a FIXTURE-LOCAL choice and NOT a mirror of this repository — an earlier
# revision of this header claimed it was, and the resemblance runs the opposite
# way. Measured at 4bb8221, in the repository's MAIN checkout: `git check-ignore
# .worktrees/` exits 1, the pattern appears nowhere in the repository's
# `.gitignore`, and `git status` there reports `?? .worktrees/`. The main checkout
# is named rather than "here" because the last of the three is vacuous read from
# inside a linked worktree — no `.worktrees/` directory exists under one — so a
# reader running the command from the wrong place would find the claim false for a
# reason that has nothing to do with the ignore. On the one property the claim
# cited — a main checkout that stays clean while holding its worktrees — this
# repository behaves the other way round.
#
# No assertion in this suite rests on the ignore either way. Verified rather than
# assumed: swapping the fixture's pattern for an unrelated one and re-running left
# the suite at 21 passed, 0 failed at 4bb8221 — a full pass, every case — because
# nothing here reads the MAIN checkout's status; the clean-tree gate runs against
# the worktree's own toplevel. The figure is pinned to a commit because it counts
# CASES and the suite grows: an earlier revision of this header carried `15/15`
# from a run six cases earlier, and a stale full-pass figure still reads as a full
# pass, so nothing about it looked wrong. The ignore is fixture hygiene, kept so a
# human debugging a fixture by hand is not met with phantom dirt. Anyone adding a
# case that DOES read the main checkout's status must re-derive this rather than
# inherit it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Case 12 and the symlink: why the fixture builds one by hand
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Case 12 asserts the claim root is byte-identical across four invocation cwds.
# It discriminates only because `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` answers in two
# different shapes, measured on git 2.55.0:
#
#   cwd = main checkout root      -> `.git`            (RELATIVE)
#   cwd = main checkout subdir    -> `../.git`         (RELATIVE)
#   cwd = worktree root or subdir -> `/abs/…/repo/.git` (ABSOLUTE, physical)
#
# The script absolutizes the relative form with `cd … && pwd -P`. Bash's `pwd` is
# LOGICAL — it echoes `$PWD` — so with a bare `pwd` the main-checkout arms inherit
# whatever spelling the caller's cwd had, while the worktree arms get the physical
# path git recorded. Two strings for one directory.
#
# On macOS that difference appears by accident: `mktemp -d` returns a path under
# `/var/folders/…` and `/var` is a symlink to `/private/var`, so the two arms
# already disagree. On `ubuntu-latest` `mktemp -d` returns `/tmp/tmp.XXXX` with no
# symlink anywhere in it, logical and physical `pwd` return the same string, and
# the case would pass whether or not the defect is present — green on the runner
# that matters, for a reason that has nothing to do with the assertion.
#
# So the fixture creates its OWN symlink and drives the two main-checkout arms
# through it. The discrimination is then a property of the fixture, identical on
# every platform, rather than a property of the platform's temp directory.
#
# Falsification recipe — re-run it after ANY edit to this case or to the script's
# claim-root resolution:
#
#   d="$(mktemp -d)"; mkdir -p "$d/scripts/tests"
#   sed 's/pwd -P/pwd/g' scripts/worktree-claim.sh > "$d/scripts/worktree-claim.sh"
#   cp scripts/tests/test-worktree-claim.sh "$d/scripts/tests/"
#   bash "$d/scripts/tests/test-worktree-claim.sh"; echo "rc=$?"
#
# Case 12 MUST fail there. If it passes, the case has stopped discriminating and
# is decoration — fix the fixture before trusting the green.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cases 17-20 and the two values this script consumes as arithmetic
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `--stale-after` (from the caller) and `since_epoch` (off disk) both reach a
# `$(( … ))`. Both were once validated as DIGITS, which is a weaker property than
# "evaluates as arithmetic", and the gap between the two admitted exactly two
# shapes:
#
#   LEADING ZERO. `$(( 08 ))` is a base error, not eight. Bash aborts with a raw
#   diagnostic naming the script's path and line, so the caller is handed the
#   script's internals instead of the script's own message.
#
#   TOO WIDE. `$(( … ))` is 64-bit and WRAPS SILENTLY. `--stale-after
#   200000000000000000` multiplies to a NEGATIVE threshold, every claim then
#   compares as stale, and the flag hands out the claim its caller asked it to
#   protect — measured against 5022270, the last revision carrying the defect:
#   rc=0, `Took over '736' from 'alice'`. The same wrap on
#   `since_epoch` runs the other way: a negative age compares as "not stale"
#   forever, and no agent can ever take the claim over. Requirement 8 inverted.
#
# WHY VALIDATION MUST PRECEDE EVALUATION, AND NOT MERELY ACCOMPANY IT. A base
# error in `$(( … ))` is a FATAL EXPANSION ERROR: a non-interactive bash exits on
# the spot, and `|| fallback` does NOT catch it — measured on bash 5.3.15 and on
# stock 3.2.57. So there is no "evaluate, then recover" design available at all;
# the only place a bad value can be caught is before the expansion. The overflow
# side reaches the same conclusion from the other direction: a numeric bound is
# itself arithmetic, so it inherits the very limits it is trying to police. `[
# "$STALE_AFTER" -gt 999999999 ]` cannot parse a 21-digit operand — bash reports
# "integer expression expected", the condition reads FALSE, and the value it was
# meant to stop sails through. `${#…}` is the only test that is not arithmetic.
# That is why the fix bounds the width textually, and cases 17-20 are built to
# fail any design that discovers the problem later than that.
#
# THE MUTATION MATRIX. Each row is a plausible alternative fix, each must turn the
# named case red, and each was RUN — not reasoned about. Assertions marked
# "coupled" are reachable only together with the exit code on that path and are
# not claimed to be independently proven.

# Recipe: copy `scripts/worktree-claim.sh` and this file into a `mktemp -d` that

# Nothing here mutates the checkout. Full verbatim output is recorded on the
# ticket; re-run the matrix after any edit to the validation block or to
# `cmd_takeover`'s `since_epoch` handling.
#
# A ROW CAN DIE WITHOUT ANYONE TOUCHING IT, AND A DEAD ROW IS GREEN. One row here
# — `since_epoch width guard dropped` — stopped reproducing at the VERY NEXT COMMIT
# after the one that introduced it. Written at 30fb24b, where it still reddened case
# 20; dead at bcc4e65, which added the clock-skew band, and dead at every commit
# since until case 20 was rewritten. The mutant's wrapped value began falling out
# through the band's CORRUPT arm, which grants the takeover just as the width guard
# does, so the mutation left the suite fully green while the row went on asserting
# the opposite. Nothing edited that row, or case 20, or the guard it covers. A LATER
# fix reached the same verdict by a second path, and the assertion could not tell
# the paths apart. Case 20 now uses a value that second path cannot reach (see the
# case, which carries the run at each of those three revisions). Every row above was
# re-run at c48aa6c, the commit that restored it, and every row OTHER than that one
# still turns its named case red at its named assertion.
#
# Two things follow for anyone re-running this. Re-running is not a formality — it
# is the only thing that detects this class of decay, because a row that has
# stopped discriminating reports as a pass, and passes are not read. And a row
# counts as re-run only if the MUTATION IS CONFIRMED TO HAVE APPLIED: a
# substitution that silently matched nothing produces exactly the same all-green
# output as a dead row. Diff the mutated copy against the original before believing
# what its run reports.
#
# A ROW CAN ALSO OVERSTATE WHAT THE RUN SEPARATES, WHICH IS THE SAME DEFECT WEARING
# THE OPPOSITE FACE. A row is checked by its COLOUR — the named case went red — but
# what it asserts sits in the `proves` column, and the two come apart without the
# row ever going green. Two rows here had. `skew band reverted` and `clamp dropped,
# band kept` both stopped case 21 at the same assertion, the skew arm's
# `held-for-seconds: 0`, because the case returned at its first failed assertion and
# the arms that tell the two mutants apart ran only after it. Reverting the band
# destroys the corrupt disposition as well as the clamp — the deadlock its `proves`
# column names — and the run never observed that half. The column was reporting a
# mechanism the suite had not checked. Measured at 4bb8221, the commit that made
# case 21 run every arm: before it, both mutants printed one identical failure;
# after, `skew band reverted` reddens all three arms and `clamp dropped, band kept`
# reddens the skew arm alone.
#
# SO A ROW'S FINGERPRINT IS (case, failing assertion) — AND A SHARED FINGERPRINT IS
# A QUESTION, NOT AUTOMATICALLY A DEFECT. `tolerance from --stale-after` and
# `corrupt iff >1 year ahead` share one too: both die at the now+900 arm's rc and
# nowhere else. Both are sound, because neither mutation's damage contains the
# other's and each dies for exactly the reason its column names. The defect is the
# SUBSET case — one mutant's damage strictly containing another's while both stop at
# the same assertion, so the containing row's extra claim goes unverified. The remedy
# is not to reword the column but to let the case run far enough to observe the
# difference, which is why case 21's arms are independent and all three execute.
#
# Two habits for a new row, then. Name the assertion, then ask what the mutant
# breaks BEYOND it: if that extra damage is what the `proves` column is really
# claiming, the case has to reach it. And when a mutation has more than one
# application SITE, the row names the count — `since_epoch fails closed` has three,
# and applying it to the zero arm alone reddens case 19 ALONE, leaving cases 20 and
# 21 green, which reads exactly like a full application of a narrower row. Measured
# at 4bb8221: all three sites, 18 passed and 3 failed; the zero arm alone, 20 passed
# and 1 failed.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Three rules that are load-bearing
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. EXIT CODES ARE CAPTURED DIRECTLY, NEVER THROUGH A PIPE. `bash x.sh | tee`
#    yields `tee`'s status, not the script's, and this repository has shipped that
#    defect before. `run_claim` redirects to files and reads `$?` off the command
#    itself.
#
# 2. BYTE-IDENTITY IS ASSERTED WITH `cmp`, AGAINST A COPY HELD OUTSIDE THE
#    WORKTREE. Cases 8 and 13 claim an uncommitted file survives an operation; a
#    copy kept inside the worktree would be destroyed by the same operation, and
#    the comparison would then be of two equally-destroyed files.
#
# 3. EVERY MEASUREMENT BELOW NAMES THE COMMIT IT WAS TAKEN AT, AND NONE IS
#    LABELLED `head`. This rule is the residue of three consecutive review rounds
#    that each found the same defect in this file: a claim that was TRUE WHEN
#    WRITTEN, went false as later commits landed, and was touched by nobody in
#    between. Nothing in CI reads a comment, so there is no signal when one rots —
#    the only detector is a human re-deriving the figure, and a plausible figure
#    never prompts anyone to. A figure pinned to a commit cannot go false; it goes
#    HISTORICAL, and a reader who wants today's value can see that it has to be
#    taken rather than read. `head` is the opposite: it re-points on every commit,
#    so the label keeps asserting that a measurement taken at some earlier revision
#    describes the current one.
#
#    Where a number carried nothing an anchor could not — a case number, a
#    subcommand, an assertion string, an arm's name — it was replaced by the anchor
#    instead of pinned, because an anchor does not go stale at all. Counts of CASES
#    are the specific trap: the suite grows, `N/N` still reads as a full pass, and
#    a stale full pass looks exactly like a fresh one. A figure that DOES come from
#    a constant in `worktree-claim.sh` names it, so the derivation is re-runnable
#    rather than remembered: 1800 is `STALE_DEFAULT_MINUTES` (30) x 60, and the
#    nine-digit ceiling on `--stale-after` is `STALE_MAX_DIGITS`. 480 is NOT one of
#    them and cannot be made one — it is case 17's own flag input `08` times the
#    bare `60` in `STALE_SECONDS="$(( STALE_AFTER * 60 ))"`, and the script defines
#    no seconds-per-minute constant to name. A figure with no constant behind it
#    spells out its whole derivation instead, which is what case 17's block does.
#
#    A DERIVED DISTANCE IS WRITTEN AS THE COMMAND THAT DERIVES IT, NOT AS A WORD.
#    This clause is younger than the rest of the rule and was paid for: f8bd54b —
#    the commit whose whole purpose was pinning the measurements above — introduced
#    a fresh wrong one, labelling bb844ab "four commits on" in case 20's ledger
#    where `git rev-list --count bcc4e65..bb844ab` answers 1. The arithmetic was
#    not the failure. Four was a REAL measurement — `git rev-list --count
#    bb844ab..4bb8221` = 4, the distance to head as that commit was being written,
#    and its message says exactly that — written into a row whose anchor is the row
#    above it. A word carries its value but not its endpoints, so it survives being
#    moved somewhere the value is wrong; a command carries both and cannot. Writing
#    a new figure is precisely the act that produces rotted ones, so a pass that
#    removes them can add one.
#
#    AND A REFERENCE OUT OF THIS FILE NAMES THE ROUND THAT ISSUED IT. A finding
#    id is as anchorless as a distance: `[REVIEW F2]` carries WHICH finding but
#    not WHOSE round, and PR #773 ran five REVIEW rounds each numbering its own
#    findings from F1. Cases 17-20 answer iteration 1's F2 and case 22 answers
#    iteration 5's, so the bare form spelled two unrelated findings identically —
#    which is why every case label reads `[REVIEW iteration <N>, F<M>]`.

# recording an event that never happened, while nothing records that bob's claim

# figure the caller never asked for. `stale-after-seconds: 480` pins the value at
# eight decimal minutes: a default fallback yields 1800 (`STALE_DEFAULT_MINUTES`,
# 30, times 60), a parse-to-zero yields 0 and grants the takeover outright, and a
# fix that rejects leading zeros instead of reading them yields rc=1.

# Catches: the silent 64-bit wrap. `--stale-after 200000000000000000` asks for
# "essentially never stale"; unfixed, `* 60` wrapped to -6446744073709551616, the
# comparison inverted, and a claim taken one second earlier was handed to bob at
# rc=0 with `Took over '736' from 'alice'`. A flag whose entire purpose is to
# PROTECT a fresh claim was the fastest way to lose one.
#
# EACH OF THE THREE VALUES DEFEATS A DIFFERENT HALF-FIX; none is a wider spelling
# of another, and each was kept only after a mutant was found that it alone fails.
#
#   200000000000000000  — the measured harm. Refused by every candidate fix, so it

#                         value that actually gave a live claim away at rc=0.
#   999999999999999999999
#                       — defeats a numeric bound that AVOIDS the multiply:
#                         `[ "$STALE_AFTER" -gt 999999999 ]` refuses the other two,
#                         but bash's own `[` cannot parse 21 digits ("integer
#                         expression expected", rc=2), the condition reads false,
#                         and the value sails through to the arithmetic. A
#                         comparison is arithmetic too. Only `${#…}` is not.
#   307445734561825861  — defeats a numeric bound applied AFTER the multiply:
#                         60 * this wraps past 2^64 to `44`, positive and small, so
#                         a "refuse a negative threshold" check waves it through to
#                         `stale-after-seconds: 44` — a flag asking for "never
#                         stale" delivering "stale in three quarters of a minute".
#
# The loop asserts the value is echoed back verbatim as well: the diagnostic must

# Case 20 [REVIEW iteration 1, F2] — an over-wide `since_epoch` does not wrap

# direction of case 18's. `$(( … ))` truncates a digit string wider than 64 bits
# SILENTLY, so an over-wide `since_epoch` does not announce itself — it evaluates,
# and what it evaluates to is unrelated to anything a clock ever produced.
# `takeover` then reports that number as the claim's age and decides on it.
#
# THE VALUE IS `2^64 + now`, AND IT IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WITH THE OBVIOUS ONE.
# This case was written with `99999999999999999999`, the reported reproduction, and
# that value stopped discriminating. One mutation — `since_epoch width guard
# dropped` — run at each revision named below, measured rather than inferred:
#
#   30fb24b  introduced this case, before the skew band
#              -> FAIL Case 20 at `expected exit 0, got 4`; 19 passed, 1 failed.
#                 True when written.
#   bcc4e65  adds the skew band; `git rev-list --count 30fb24b..bcc4e65` = 1
#              -> 20 passed, 0 failed. Dead already, one commit later.
#   bb844ab  `git rev-list --count bcc4e65..bb844ab` = 1 — the next commit again;
#            still on `99999999999999999999`
#              -> 21 passed, 0 failed. Still dead, still reading as a pass.
#   c48aa6c  this case rewritten onto `2^64 + now`
#              -> FAIL Case 20 at `expected exit 0, got 4`, stdout carrying
#                 `held-for-seconds: 0`; 20 passed, 1 failed. Alive again.
#
# THE LAST ROW IS THE ONE THAT CERTIFIES THE FIX, and an earlier revision of this
# block did not carry it: it stopped at `bb844ab, head`, so the only measurement on
# the page was the DEAD one, under a label asserting that state was current. When
# bb844ab stopped being head the label did not stop claiming it was. That is why
# every row above names a commit and none names `head` — a ledger of revisions can
# only go out of date by being INCOMPLETE, which a reader can see; `head` goes out
# of date by being WRONG, which a reader cannot.
#
# The mechanism is the clock-skew band added in bcc4e65. `99999999999999999999`
# never reaches the comparison as itself: `$(( … ))` wraps it to
# 7766279631452241919, a timestamp some 246 billion years ahead, so the age it
# yields is negative by that same order — far past the band's tolerance
# (`CLOCK_SKEW_TOLERANCE_SECONDS`, 300) — and it leaves through the CORRUPT arm.
# Takeable, which is the same verdict the width guard gives, reached by a different
# path. The assertion cannot tell the two
# apart, so it went on reading as a test of the guard while testing nothing.
#
# (An earlier revision quoted the resulting AGE here rather than the wrapped value.
# An age is `now` minus that constant, so it moves once a second: it could not be
# pinned to any commit, and the figure printed on the page was already hours stale
# by the time anyone read it. The wrapped value is a constant, and `$(( … ))` in
# any bash re-derives it in one line.)
#
# `2^64 + now` is the value that second path cannot reach. It wraps to `now`
# exactly, so the age is d — the seconds between the fixture stamping the file and
# the script reading its own clock, measured 0 in the c48aa6c row above — which is
# not negative, never reaches the band, and sits below the 1800-second default
# threshold (`STALE_DEFAULT_MINUTES` x 60). Without the guard the script answers
# `Refused: … is not stale` with
# `held-for-seconds: 0`: a fabricated age, indistinguishable in the output from a
# claim taken this second. The slack is one-sided and large — d ≥ 0 holds by
# construction for any clock, and the refusal this case defeats holds for any
# d < 1800 — so no arm of it depends on which way a clock drifts.
#
# WHAT THE GUARD IS WORTH, STATED HONESTLY. Since the skew band, the wrap is no
# longer a deadlock for most over-wide values: one that lands far in the future
# leaves through the corrupt arm, one that lands far in the past exceeds every
# threshold, and both grant the takeover — correctly, but by luck rather than by
# decision. What is left is the window where the wrap lands near `now`, and there
# the stall is bounded by `--stale-after`: 30 minutes at the default, and up to the
# maximum the flag accepts (`STALE_MAX_DIGITS`, 9 digits of minutes) — roughly 1900
# years — for a caller who asked for a long protection window. Bounded is not
# benign. The stranded agent R8 exists for is told the claim is fresh and is given
# nothing in the output to
# suggest otherwise, which is the same wrong answer the original 20-digit value
# produced, minus the arithmetic that made it obvious.
#
# Kept apart from case 19 rather than folded in as a second arm, because the two
# corrupt shapes fail differently on the unfixed script — rc=1 with a shell abort
# there, rc=4 with a plausible-looking refusal here. A refusal that looks like a
# considered decision is the more dangerous of the two, and it deserves a PASS/FAIL
# line that names it. No `want_no_shell_error` here: this path never aborted, and
# an assertion that cannot fail is the decoration this suite refuses.

# Case 21 [REVIEW iteration 1, out of F2's fix] — a `since_epoch` in the FUTURE
# is sorted into clock skew, which still protects the claim, and corruption,
# which does not. No reviewer numbered this one: it surfaced while F2 was being
# fixed and `team-lead` ruled it in scope rather than deferring it, so the label
# names F2's fix rather than a finding id. Recorded in the iteration-1 closeout
# on issue #736.
# Catches: the R8 violation that survived the first fix. `since_epoch` was made
# safe against values that could not be EVALUATED, and a future timestamp
# evaluates perfectly — it just evaluates to a negative age, which is below every
# threshold, so `takeover` answered `Refused: … is not stale` and would answer
# that until wall-clock caught up. At 18 digits that is roughly three billion
# years: a claim no agent can ever take over, which is precisely the state R8
# exists to dissolve.
#
# THE TWO DISPOSITIONS HAVE TO BE TESTED TOGETHER, and that is the whole design of
# this case. Granting the takeover on any negative age would satisfy the R8 half
# of it while making every fresh claim in the system stealable by a peer whose
# clock runs a few seconds fast — R5's simultaneous-belief state, reintroduced
# silently to fix R8. So the case asserts a refusal AND a grant, and neither arm
# alone would be worth writing.
#
#   now+300  -> REFUSED, `held-for-seconds: 0`   skew: read as "taken just now"
#   now+900  -> GRANTED                          past the 300s tolerance: corrupt
#   18 digits-> GRANTED                          the reported reproduction
#
# `held-for-seconds: 0` is load-bearing and is not a restatement of the refusal.
# It asserts the age was CLAMPED, not merely found negative-and-refused, which is
# what the unfixed script also did — there the same arm prints a NEGATIVE age, and
# the exact figure is d-300, so it reads -300 when d is 0 and -299 when d is 1. The
# assertion is on the clamped 0, never on the negative value, for
# that reason. It is the only assertion in this case that separates the fix from
# the defect on the skew side, because on that side both refuse.
#
# EVERY ARM RUNS, AND THE CASE STILL RECORDS ONE PASS OR FAIL. The three arms are
# independent — three fixtures, sharing only the clock read at the top — so the case
# runs all of them and accumulates, rather than returning at the first failure. That
# is not tidiness: two matrix rows differ ONLY in the arms after the skew one, and
# while the case short-circuited they produced byte-identical output and the matrix
# could not tell them apart. See the fingerprint note in the header. Because each
# arm's stdout is folded into WHY by `arm_fail` at the point of failure, the OUT/ERR
# globals are cleared before returning: by then they hold the LAST arm's output,
# which would attach the wrong evidence to the right complaint.
#
# WHY THE EXACT 300/301 EDGE IS NOT PINNED. It cannot be, without freezing the
# clock. Let d be the seconds between the fixture stamping the file and the script
# reading its own clock; a value written as now+N presents an age of d-N. So
# now+301 classifies as corrupt only while d-301 < -300, i.e. only while d == 0. A
# case pinned there would be asserting that a `git init`, a commit, a `worktree
# add` and two script invocations all land inside one wall-clock second — a
# property of the machine's load, not of the script, and one that fails outright on
# a loaded runner where d grows. Stated as a bound rather than as a flake RATE on
# purpose: a rate is measured on one machine and does not transfer to the runner
# that matters. The values above were chosen for the opposite
# property: now+300 stays skew for any d < 300, and now+900 stays corrupt for any
# d < 600. Both hold with minutes of slack against a d measured in single seconds.
# An off-by-one in a five-minute heuristic safety band has no consequence worth an
# intermittently red suite; a flaky case would cost more than the bound it guards.
#
# THE 18-DIGIT ARM WAS KEPT ON SUSPICION AND THEN EARNED IT. It was written as the
# reported reproduction, and as the only corrupt-side value that rests on no clock
# assumption at all; on the mutants built for the other two arms it never failed,
# which is this suite's definition of decoration, and it was nearly dropped for
# the reason the `09` arm of case 17 was. A mutant found afterwards separates it:
# flooring an "absurd" age to zero instead of reading it as infinitely old — the
# tempting extra guard against a very large negative — leaves now+300 and now+900
# both correct and refuses the 18-digit claim forever. The arm goes red alone
# there. Do not drop it on the grounds that it duplicates now+900; it does not.
#
# It earns its place a second way now that the arms all run: it is one of the two
# arms that separate `skew band reverted` from `clamp dropped, band kept`, which
# were indistinguishable while the case stopped at the skew arm.

# Case 22 [REVIEW iteration 5, F2] — a value-taking flag in FINAL position is
# refused BY NAME, not by exiting 1 with both streams empty.
# Catches: the one refusal in this script that said nothing at all. `--agent` last
# on the line leaves `shift 2` asking for more parameters than remain; `shift`
# then fails, and under `set -euo pipefail` (line 191) the script exits 1 having
# printed nothing to either stream.
#
# THE EXIT CODE IS THE SAME ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FIX, SO THE CODE CANNOT BE THE
# ASSERTION. Measured, both scripts extracted with `git show` into a `mktemp -d`,
# invoked as `status --agent`:
#
#   f8bd54b (before)  -> rc=1, stdout empty, stderr empty
#   44d0c9b (after)   -> rc=1, stderr `Error: '--agent' requires a value: …`
#
# A case asserting `want_rc 1` alone is therefore GREEN AGAINST THE UNFIXED
# SCRIPT. It would sit here looking exactly like coverage while certifying
# nothing — the same false-green this file's header exists to argue against, and
# the reason this case asserts the DIAGNOSTIC and treats the code as incidental.
#
# ONE FLAG, DELIBERATELY — the same rule case 17 states for its absent `09` arm.
# All four value-taking flags (`--agent`, `--ticket`, `--operation`,
# `--stale-after`) reach `require_value` through one call each, so no mutant can
# fail one arm while passing another: dropping the guard silences all four, and
# restoring it fixes all four. Three more arms would be three more things to
# maintain and nothing more proven. `--stale-after` is the one worth a note: its
# empty value never reaches the digit validation cases 17-18 cover, because the
# failing `shift` aborts first — so that path too is this case's, not theirs.
#
# TWO ASSERTIONS, AND THE OTHERS WERE WRITTEN THEN REMOVED — the rule case 17
# states for its absent `09` arm, applied here to arms this case's own author had
# already drafted. Both removals were measured, not reasoned:
#
#   * `want_no_shell_error` — kept in the first draft against a bare-`$2` mutant,
#     which under `set -u` does abort with `worktree-claim.sh: line 323: $2:
#     unbound variable` (measured; it printed in French on the authoring machine,
#     which is exactly why that helper matches the script's PATH and not the
#     message). But that mutant fails the diagnostic assertion FIRST, so the arm
#     is never reached. No mutant fails it while passing what precedes it.
#   * a `take --agent alice` / `holder: alice` tail, asserting the refusal left
#     the worktree claimable. It cannot fail: this fix lives in the parse loop,
#     which runs before any claim is touched, and `take` with an empty agent is
#     independently refused by the `--agent <name> is required` guard that
#     predates this fix. The arm re-tested a neighbouring guarantee and would
#     have reported that as coverage of this one.
#
# `want_rc 1` earns its place on a different mutant than the message does: a

# The break spec 0126 R3 accepts, pinned. A `run` from a SUBDIRECTORY of the
# worktree now executes at the worktree ROOT, so a wrapped command's cwd — and with
# it every relative path and every cwd-scoped operation, `git clean -fdx` above all
# — moves. Accepted deliberately; unpinned it would be merely asserted.
#
# The expectation is NORMALIZED, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy.
# $TOPLEVEL is physical (the script resolves it through `pwd -P`), while `fx_wt`
# concatenates strings over a bare `mktemp -d`. On macOS those differ —
# /var/folders/… against /private/var/folders/… — so an unnormalized expectation
# fails on the maintainer's machine and passes on ubuntu-latest, which is a green
# certifying the platform rather than the behaviour. The suite's header documents
# the same asymmetry as load-bearing for case 12.
#
# Compared for EQUALITY, not with want_out: the root is a prefix of the
# subdirectory, so a substring assertion would be satisfied by the very value this
# case exists to reject.
