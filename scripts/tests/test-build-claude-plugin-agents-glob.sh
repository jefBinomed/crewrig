# test-build-claude-plugin-agents-glob.sh — Regression test for the "Copy
# agents" step of build-claude-plugin.sh (issue #600).
#
# Pins the fix: the step MUST copy only the files matched by the fixed
# default glob (agents/*/AGENT.md), never `cp -r` the whole agent directory.
# A sibling pivot file for another CLI (e.g. PROMPT.md, the Gemini pivot
# source per extension-skeleton/agent/agents/sample-agent/PROMPT.md) must NOT
# leak into the Claude plugin output, where Claude Code would register it as
# a bogus second agent.
#
# Repointed at the fixed default glob (spec 0183 R7, PLAN step 10): the
# per-extension `claude.agents` override this test used to exercise is
# retired — it was read only as an override whose own default was this same
# glob, and both committed manifests already carried `[]`, so the override
# case (formerly Case 3) is dropped rather than repointed at a capability
# that no longer exists.
#
# Cases:
#   1. AGENT.md + sibling PROMPT.md → AGENT.md copied, PROMPT.md NOT copied.
#   2. AGENT.md only, no sibling → still copied (no regression on the
#      normal case).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-build-claude-plugin-agents-glob.sh
#
# -e is intentionally omitted: exit codes / file presence are asserted via
# explicit pass/fail counters.
