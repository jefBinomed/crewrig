# test-check-bash32-portability.sh — Regression tests for
# check-bash32-portability.sh (spec 0111).
#
# check-bash32-portability.sh is the CI guard that fails when a governed script
# under scripts/ or hooks/ uses a shell construct the Bash shipped with macOS
# (3.2.57) does not have. This is the parity sibling mandated by the repo
# convention "every check-*.sh has a test-*.sh" (spec 0076 R6).
#
# Cases, one per spec 0111 scenario:
#   a. A reintroduced forbidden construct is rejected, naming file and line
#      (scenario 1, R1/R3).
#   b. The repository as it stands is accepted (scenario 2, R6). This case is
#      also what catches the guard flagging its own source or its own declared
#      set — both live inside or beside the tree it scans.
#   c. A comment naming a forbidden construct is accepted (scenario 3, R4), as
#      is `declare -a`, which is not `declare -A`.
#   d. A line carrying the acknowledged-exception marker is accepted
#      (scenario 4, R10).
#   e. A forbidden construct in a *test* script is rejected on the same terms as
#      in a shipped script (scenario 6, R5).
#   f. Every construct in the declared set is named in Rule 5 of
#      docs/scripting-conventions.md (R2's "one place both the enforcement and
#      the documentation refer to"). This is the doc-to-data link that no other
#      gate covers. Per spec 0120 it no longer parses ci/bash32-forbidden.txt
#      itself: it consumes the report the enforcement returns for the set it
#      actually read (`--list-constructs`), through the `sync_status` helper,
#      which echoes one of `ok:<n>` / `missing:<list>` / `vacuous` / `unaskable`.
#      Three call sites assert that discrimination — the repository (`ok:<n>`
#      with n > 0, cross-checked against the verdict run's own count), a
#      comment-only declared set (`unaskable`), and a set holding a construct
#      absent from Rule 5 (`missing:<list>`).
#   g. A declared set with no usable entry fails closed rather than passing
#      vacuously (docs/scripting-conventions.md Rule 4).
#   h. No array expansion in the six suites corrected under R6 is unguarded —
#      the standing half of scenario 5 (R8). See `bare_expansions_in`.
#   i. That detector is itself probed on 13 fixtures in both directions, so a
#      future narrowing of it fails here rather than silently going quiet.
#   j. Asking the guard what it read neither scans the governed tree nor renders
#      a verdict, and an unrecognised argument is refused rather than falling
#      through to a verdict run (spec 0120 R3).
#   k. Both requests refuse the same declared sets and accept the same ones —
#      case g's five malformed shapes replayed against each, plus a sixth whose
#      malformed row follows two valid ones, plus the converse on a well-formed
#      set (spec 0120 R5). Each refusal is asserted on exit status, stderr AND
#      empty stdout, the last being the scenario's "it reports no construct".
#   l. The comment stripper is probed on 8 fixtures covering quote state, so a
#      regression in comment handling fails here rather than widening or
#      narrowing the phase-2 scan's view of a line (spec 0124 R6).
#
# Cases h, i, and l all pull their fixture rows from .tsv files under
# scripts/tests/fixtures/. Those files live outside the phase-2 scan's tree,
# so they can hold example unguarded expansions without the enforcement
# flagging them.
#
# Scenario 5 — a corrected suite reports the same verdicts on both shells — is
# only partly scriptable here: comparing two shells needs two Bash binaries, and
# that half is discharged by the recorded two-shell evidence run on issue #697.
# The half that CAN be re-proved every run is case h's invariant: a guarded
# expansion cannot abort under `set -u`, so guarding all of them removes the
# class the two-shell run merely samples.
#
# Fixtures are written with `printf '%s\n' 'line' 'line'`, never a heredoc, and
# that is load-bearing rather than stylistic. This file lives under the tree the
# guard scans, and the guard flags a declared token in command position; in a
# heredoc body a fixture line would start with the token and be reported, turning
# case b red on the very change that introduces the gate. In the printf form
# every token sits immediately after a quote, so it is never in command position.
# Self-exempting this file with the acknowledged-exception marker is not the
# fallback: R5 governs test scripts "on the same terms", and R6 requires
# correction rather than exemption.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-check-bash32-portability.sh

# -e intentionally omitted: pass/fail counters drive the harness; adding -e
# would abort on the expected non-zero exits from the script under test.

# This is the standing half of scenario 5. The two-shell evidence run proves the
# corrected suites report identical verdicts today; nothing re-proves it
# tomorrow, because CI runs Bash 5 where the defect is invisible. What CAN be
# re-proved cheaply is the invariant the correction established: in these six
# suites, no array is expanded without a guard.
#
# Why that invariant is the right proxy. Under `set -u` Bash 3.2 aborts on an
# empty-array expansion where Bash 5 does not. The abort is not reliably visible
# either: these suites run `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e`, so when the
# expansion sits in a command substitution or subshell only that child dies —
# the suite continues and can exit 0 with cases silently skipped. So neither a
# zero exit status nor a clean-looking summary is evidence the suite ran
# everything, which is exactly how the false green in issue #697 was produced.
# A guarded expansion cannot abort, so guarding every one of them removes the
# class rather than the symptom.
#
# This case also settles a judgement call recorded on the ticket: expansions on
# arrays that provably cannot be empty were guarded too. Uniform guarding is
# only worth its noise if something checks it — this is that something, and it
# is why the uniform choice is an invariant rather than cargo cult.
