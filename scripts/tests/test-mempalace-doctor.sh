# test-mempalace-doctor.sh — Regression tests for the operator diagnostic
# scripts/doctor-mempalace.sh (spec 0108 R7-R11, issue #623).
#
# Unit under test: the doctor, executed for real against a fabricated machine —
# a temp HOME carrying all four CLI MCP registration files, a temp PATH carrying
# fake `mempalace` / `mempalace-mcp` console scripts, and several fake checkouts.
#
# HOW IT IS HERMETIC. Two devices do all the work:
#   - A fake `mempalace-<version>.dist-info/METADATA` on PYTHONPATH wins over any
#     real install for `importlib.metadata.version()`, so an arbitrary version is
#     fabricable without installing anything.
#   - An "interpreter" is a tiny shell shim that execs the real interpreter with
#     PYTHONPATH pointed at one of those fake sites. Registering a shim as the
#     interpreter therefore pins exactly which version that registration serves.
#     This is sound because the doctor READS a console script's shebang as text
#     and then invokes that interpreter itself — it never execs the console
#     script, so no shebang-length or exec semantics are involved.
#
# Contract asserted:
#   (a) both registration argv shapes are resolved to the same interpreter: the
#       discriminator is the `[.command] + .args` concatenation, not a position
#       inside `.args`. `bash tls-exec.sh <py> <wrapper>` and `<py> <wrapper>`
#       must both name <py>.
#   (b) divergence: `mempalace` serving one version while `mempalace-mcp` serves
#       another is reported for BOTH paths, exits non-zero, and names which path
#       carries the out-of-range version.
#   (c) a registration whose checkout has no mempalace_pin.py reports GUARD
#       ABSENT — a label DISTINCT from the UNGUARDED a wrapper-less argv gets.
#   (d) a registration pointing at a checkout whose common.sh declares a
#       different pin is reported as a pin divergence.
#   (e) R10: candidate 1 absent -> an explicit fallback-selected line naming both
#       the skipped candidate and the winner, plus the winner's version;
#       candidate 1 present -> no fallback line at all.
#   (f) R9: an install under a directory named after no known installer is still
#       fully reported.
#   (g) R4: the restart sentence prints on every outcome, clean or not.
#   (h) a clean machine exits 0.
#   (h2) a dist-info / `mempalace.__version__` disagreement is REPORTED and is
#       neither a divergence nor a non-zero outcome — the doctor half of the
#       wrapper's decision not to refuse on disagreement.
#   (h3) R8's second trigger on its own: every source agreeing on the SAME
#       out-of-range version still exits non-zero, with no divergence involved.
#       Same machine covers the `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang form, whose
#       interpreter is the second token.
#   (h4) R8's FIRST trigger on its own — the mirror image of (h3), and the spec's
#       headline "Divergent installs are reported and flagged" scenario. Two
#       sources report DIFFERENT versions, both INSIDE the pin, against ONE pin:
#       so neither the range trigger nor the pin-divergence trigger can produce
#       the outcome, and only the version-divergence detection can. Scenario 1
#       fires all three triggers at once, which is why a bare `DIVERGE` grep there
#       is answered by the pin-divergence line and proves nothing about this one.
#   (i) a registration whose wrapper FILE is gone while its `scripts/lib/`
#       directory survives is reported as WRAPPER MISSING — a verdict that must
#       come from the wrapper's own existence, not from whether a `cd` two levels
#       above it succeeds.
#   (j) a registration whose interpreter resolves NO mempalace distribution at
#       all is reported as NO VERSION and is a non-successful outcome — and the
#       report says only that. Neither divergence trigger nor the range trigger
#       may stand in for the finding, because such a source contributes no
#       version to compare and none to range-check.
#   (l) issue #1417: a console script whose venv path contains a space is a
#       `#!/bin/sh` polyglot wrapper (pip/distlib double-quoted form, uv
#       single-quoted form). The interpreter is read from its exec line, or
#       from the sibling `python` of the script's realpath when that line is
#       unparseable — and a shell is NEVER reported as the interpreter, in
#       section 2 or as a section-3 candidate. The pipx candidate follows pipx's
#       own home resolution (`PIPX_HOME`, legacy `~/.local/pipx`, platform
#       default) and the candidate list carries no duplicate.
#   (k) R11 (structural): every CLI's launch path names the wrapper — for two
#       CLIs in the setup script, for the other two in the committed MCP template
#       the setup script patches. The assertion spans script AND template, or it
#       would fail on a correct tree.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-mempalace-doctor.sh
#
# Override the interpreter with CREWRIG_TEST_PYTHON (default: python3).

# -e intentionally omitted: pass/fail counters control the harness, and several
# scenarios intentionally assert a non-zero exit.
