# residue repair command (spec 0165).
#
# The command under test is scripts/repair-mempalace-http.sh. It is a pure
# file-level repair: it reads and rewrites assistant MCP configuration files
# under $HOME and never touches supervisor state, ports, or the daemon, so the
# isolation contract is the single $HOME axis: mcp_assistant_config_path
# (common.sh) derives all four config paths from $HOME alone, and nothing here
# invokes a real CLI. That single axis is sufficient only for as long as that
# derivation holds: Claude Code itself resolves its user config through
# CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, so if common.sh ever learns to honour that variable, this
# suite must redirect it too or it silently escapes isolation and rewrites the
# operator's real ~/.claude.json. The sibling suite test-mcp-daemon.sh already
# exports CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR deliberately — it owes coverage on the Claude arm
# (the switch transaction, the Claude reader) that this pure file-level suite
# never will — so the two suites differ on purpose, not by omission.
# The "present" gate is `command -v`, so each CLI is stubbed on PATH exactly as
# test-mcp-daemon.sh section 11 does.
