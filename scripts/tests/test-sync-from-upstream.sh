# test-sync-from-upstream.sh — Regression tests for sync-from-upstream.sh.
#
# Cases:
#   1. Clean-core sync: no local modifications → exit 0, files reflect upstream
#   2. Dirty-core refusal: core path modified → exit non-zero, stderr names it
#   3. Empty canonical_repo: canonical_repo = "" → exit non-zero, no git fetch
#   4. Absent canonical_repo: key missing entirely → exit non-zero, no git fetch
#
# Spec-0020 policy cases:
#   a. Excluded org subtree untouched while sibling core path updates, AND a
#      customized specs/org/* file does NOT abort the sync (Finding 1).
#   b. Unmodified adopt-on-edit file updated from upstream.
#   c. Modified (non-upstream-historical) adopt-on-edit file frozen, exit 0.
#   d. Strict path still aborts on local edit (regression).
#   e. Marker directory present → sync does NOT abort on the strict .crewrig
#      parent (Finding 1, v3 marker carve-out).
#   f. Empty marker + current blob matches an OLDER upstream version → updates
#      (stale-but-unmodified vendored fork, Finding 2 R6 horn).
#   g. Empty marker + current blob matches NO upstream version → freezes,
#      exit 0, and the freeze marker records the ADOPTER's own blob
#      (pre-feature customization, Finding 2 R7 horn — no data loss).
#
# Spec-0021 directory adopt-on-edit cases (reconcile_dir):
#   h. R3 ADD — upstream ships a file with no org history; AFTER fetching the
#      upstream as a remote (so refs/remotes carry the blob), the new file is
#      ADDed. The fetch-before-assert guards against the `git rev-list --all`
#      leak that the cold review caught (--all would see the blob via
#      refs/remotes and wrongly SKIP).
#   i. R2 SKIP — org committed then deleted a file still shipped upstream; sync
#      does NOT re-create it.
#   j. Org-customized file inside the dir → frozen, not overwritten.
#   k. Untouched dir file matching an upstream history blob → updated.
#   l. Org-deleted file that upstream later re-touches → stays gone across a
#      second sync.
#   m. Shallow-clone guard — a shallow adopter clone refuses to reconcile the
#      adopt-on-edit directory (warns, exit 0, no add) rather than trust an
#      untrustworthy history.
#
# Spec-0031 phantom-entry tolerance cases:
#   n. Phantom tolerance — the manifest declares a strict entry absent from the
#      fetched upstream AND a resolvable adopt-on-edit sibling. The sync warns
#      once for the phantom (apply-loop warn-and-skip; the strict dirty guard
#      skips it silently), restores the resolvable sibling from upstream, and
#      exits 0. The warn line appears EXACTLY once. This case bites if the
#      apply-loop `resolves_at_fetch_head` guard is reverted: `set -e` + a
#      `git restore` on a non-existent FETCH_HEAD path would exit non-zero.
#   o. Clean-sync negative assertion — a fully resolvable manifest emits NO
#      "Warning: skipping manifest entry" line on stderr (spec 0031 "fully
#      resolvable manifest syncs cleanly" scenario; architect advisory #1).
#
# Spec-0064 strict-directory orphan cleanup cases:
#   r. Orphan deletion — a strict directory contains a locally tracked file
#      absent from FETCH_HEAD; the file is deleted, stdout contains
#      "Removed (upstream-deleted): <path>", and exit 0.
#   s. Excluded child preserved — a file under an excluded child of a strict
#      directory is absent from FETCH_HEAD but NOT deleted.
#
# Spec-0086 --preserve-history regression cases (R13):
#   t. Happy path (R5-R6) — after a successful --preserve-history sync, the
#      fetched upstream commit (FETCH_HEAD) is a real ancestor of the current
#      branch tip (git merge-base --is-ancestor), and every restored file is
#      byte-for-byte identical to what an ordinary sync (no flag) would have
#      produced.
#   u. No-op (R11) — when FETCH_HEAD is already an ancestor of the current
#      branch tip at invocation time, no new commit is created and the sync
#      exits 0.
#   v. Shallow-clone refusal (R12) — on a shallow clone, the sync exits
#      non-zero BEFORE any fetch, restore, or commit.
#   w. Unrelated-change refusal (R8) — an uncommitted change outside the
#      paths governed by .crewrig/core-paths.txt and .crewrig/.synced-markers/
#      blocks the graft commit after the policy-aware restore has already
#      applied; the offending path is printed, no commit is created, and the
#      sync exits non-zero.
#   x. Nested-excluded-child refusal (R8, PLAN v2 arch-finding fix) — an
#      uncommitted change under an `excluded` entry nested under a
#      `strict`/`adopt-on-edit` parent (e.g. specs/org under specs) blocks the
#      graft commit exactly like case w, even though the path falls inside the
#      governing parent's own prefix; the strict parent's own restore still
#      applies before the guard fires.
#   y. Direct-excluded-entry refusal (R8, PLAN v2 arch-finding fix) — an
#      uncommitted change under a top-level `excluded` manifest entry with no
#      governing parent overlap (e.g. AGENTS.org.md) blocks the graft commit
#      via the same path_is_governed() carve-out, independently of the nested
#      form covered by case x.
#
# Spec-0097 Copilot settings.json workspace-scope carve-out cases (issue #605):
#   z. R8 — a local content mutation confined to
#      `.github/copilot/settings.json` (an `excluded` entry nested under the
#      still-`strict` `.github/copilot` parent), representative of the
#      transcript-hooks hook-merge opt-in, does NOT abort the strict
#      dirty-guard for `.github/copilot`, and the mutated content survives
#      the sync's restore step untouched.
#  aa. R9 — a local content mutation confined to the sibling
#      `.github/copilot/extension.json` (still `strict`, no exclusion) DOES
#      abort the strict dirty-guard for `.github/copilot`, exactly as before
#      the carve-out — guards against the narrow-scope fix silently widening
#      to the whole directory.
#  bb. R10 — the real repo's own `.gitignore` matches a representative
#      `.github/copilot/settings.json.bak.<timestamp>` filename in the shape
#      produced by `backup_file()`, and does NOT match the sibling
#      `extension.json` (pattern stayed narrow).
#
# Spec-0122 signed-graft-commit cases (issue #756):
#  cc. R1, R2, R6, R7 — a repository configured to sign (gpg.format ssh, an
#      ephemeral ed25519 key, commit.gpgsign true) gets a SIGNED graft commit
#      that still carries both parents, whose second parent is the fetched
#      upstream commit byte-for-byte, and whose creation is reported with a
#      `(signed)` suffix on stdout.
#  dd. R3 — a repository that does not sign (commit.gpgsign false) gets an
#      unsigned graft commit, exit 0, no `(signed)` on stdout, and no
#      signing-related line on stderr: the non-signing path gains nothing.
#  ee. R4, R5 — commit.gpgsign true with a user.signingkey that does not
#      exist: the sync refuses, creates no commit, leaves the branch tip
#      where it stood, leaves the restored content in the working tree, and
#      names the unproducible signature in its OWN message. git's signing
#      diagnostic is localized, so no assertion here may read it.
#  ff. R8 — the no-op path (FETCH_HEAD already an ancestor) still exits 0 in
#      a repository configured to sign but unable to: no commit means no
#      signature to produce, so signing capability is never probed.
#  gg. R1, R5 — commit.gpgsign holds a value git cannot read as a boolean.
#      `git commit` itself exits 128 in such a repository, so reporting a
#      successful sync would breach R1 on its face. Guards the shape of the
#      predicate: a config read placed in the word of a `[ … ]` test inside
#      an `if` condition discards git's 128 (errexit is suspended there) and
#      silently produces an unsigned commit with exit 0.
#  hh. R5 ordering — a gpg.ssh.program that exits 0 without writing a
#      signature makes `commit-tree -S` exit 0 and produce a commit with no
#      gpgsig header. The sync must refuse with the branch tip UNMOVED; the
#      same check placed after update-ref would refuse with the tip already
#      on the unsigned commit, satisfying R5 by violating R4.
#  ii. R3 by absence — commit.gpgsign unset, which is the modal non-signing
#      shape and the one no other case reaches (init_git_repo pins it to
#      `false`). Invoked with the operator's own configuration neutralised,
#      because the predicate resolves through global config too.
#  jj. R1, R2 in a SHA-256 repository (PR #803 review) — git's signature
#      header name is hash-algorithm dependent: `gpgsig` under SHA-1,
#      `gpgsig-sha256` under `--object-format=sha256`. A `^gpgsig ` pattern
#      WITH a trailing space matches the first and misses the second, so the
#      R5 post-condition refuses a signature it had just produced and reports
#      the opposite of what happened. Guards both readers of that pattern —
#      the script's post-condition and commit_is_signed.
#
# Spec-0199 `regenerable` policy cases (issue #1119, plan step 9 — written and
# proven red against the unmodified script before step 10 edits it). Letters
# continue the suite's convention; PLAN v2's proposed kk-pp collide with the
# spec-0129/0148 cases already occupying those letters above, so these use
# qq-vv instead:
#  qq. A diverged member under a `regenerable` directory entry does not
#      abort: exit 0, the member is restored from upstream, and stdout
#      reports it as restored-over-diverged (R42, R48).
#  rr. A diverged member under a still-`strict` compiled skill entry still
#      aborts: exit 1, stderr names it — the regression control that proves
#      the widened arm did not silently spread to the skill/command trees
#      (R45, R50).
#  ss. A fork with no divergence is unaffected (R47, R50), restated per the
#      APPROVE verdict's v2-F5 fix as a two-run differential rather than a
#      comparison against an unobtainable "pre-change" baseline: one run
#      with the four agent trees `strict`, one with them `regenerable`, over
#      an otherwise-identical fixture with no divergence — the two runs'
#      resulting worktrees and stdout/stderr streams must be byte-identical.
#  tt. `--preserve-history` (spec 0086 R8): an uncommitted change under a
#      `regenerable` entry does not block the graft commit; one under an
#      unlisted path still does (R49).
#  uu. The spec-0064 orphan cleanup still runs under `regenerable`: a locally
#      tracked file absent from upstream is removed and reported, exactly as
#      the `strict` policy already behaves (Decision 6).
#  vv. An org channel file nested under the still-`strict` `model-mappings`
#      parent is neither restored nor able to abort the sync — the R5
#      carve-out this ticket's manifest entries rely on (R5).
#  ww. A fork lands on the new flat compiled-agent layout without acting (spec 0201).
#
# Spec-0204 organization-tier compiled skill/command preservation cases (issue #1137):
#  xx. Active org-owned compiled skill under strict directory is preserved across sync (R1, R2).
#  yy. Active org-owned compiled command under strict directory is preserved across sync (R1, R2).
#  zz. Upstream-deleted core skill is removed by orphan cleanup (R3).
#  aaa. Retired organization skill is cleaned up as orphan when definition removed (R4).
#
# Spec-0064/0020 regression case (issue #1213):
#  bbb. `ci/org/` declared `excluded` (nested under the strict `ci` parent,
#       same pattern as case s for `specs/org`) is NOT deleted by the strict
#       directory's orphan-cleanup pass, and does not abort the dirty guard.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-sync-from-upstream.sh

# -e intentionally omitted: pass/fail counters control the harness; adding -e
# would abort on expected non-zero exits from the script under test.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Case jj — spec 0122 R1, R2 in a SHA-256 repository (PR #803 cold review).
# Git's signature header name is hash-algorithm dependent: `gpgsig` in a SHA-1
# repository, `gpgsig-sha256` in one created with --object-format=sha256. A
# `^gpgsig ` pattern WITH a trailing space matches the first and misses the
# second, so the R5 post-condition refuses a signature it had just
# successfully produced: no commit at all where an ordinary `git commit` makes
# a signed one. That breaches R1 and R2 rather than serving R5, and the
# refusal message names a cause that did not occur.
#
# Both readers of the pattern are covered, independently:
#   - restore the space in sync-from-upstream.sh -> fails on exit code, on the
#     unmoved HEAD, and on the missing `(signed)`;
#   - restore it in commit_is_signed only        -> fails on that assertion
#     alone, with the sync itself still green.
#
# Reachability is narrow and worth stating: a SHA-256 fork of a SHA-1 upstream
# never gets here, because `git fetch` refuses the object-format mismatch
# first. The fixture therefore needs SHA-256 on BOTH ends — which
# `canonical_repo` permits.
#
# The object format is fixed at init time, so `git init` runs with the flag
# first; a plain re-init inside init_git_repo preserves it (measured) and
# supplies the identity plus the `commit.gpgsign false` pin that keeps the
# fixture's own commits hermetic before the signing config goes on.

# verbatim but C-quotes control characters, so a member can hold a space and can
