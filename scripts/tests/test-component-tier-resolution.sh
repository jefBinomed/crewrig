# test-component-tier-resolution.sh — Regression tests for spec 0119
# (overlay-tier component resolution on the per-component install surface).
#
# Spec 0119 requirement 20 obliges automated checks that FAIL when a served tier
# becomes unreachable on either request shape, when a landing zone or resolution
# basis diverges from the assisted setup of the same CLI, when two components
# sharing an installed name in one landing zone are accepted by the build, or
# when an install command resolves such a pair without reporting it. Each case
# below names the requirement(s) it guards.
#
# ── Standing instruction this file was written under ─────────────────────────
# Every case here was authored BEFORE the fix and observed to fail against the
# unfixed code. A case that has only ever been seen to pass is evidence of
# nothing. The two cases that cannot be made to fail against the unfixed code
# are labelled GUARD and say why in place — they are over-refusal bounds, not
# regression cases, and their vacuity is stated rather than hidden.
#
# Cases 13b, 13c and 13d were authored AFTER the fix, against commits f071215
# and 373fe66, and the same rule was applied rather than waived: each was
# observed to fail against the specific code shape it guards being broken —
# the pre-hoist mid-loop `core` validation for 13d, the pruned-roots paragraph
# deleted for 13c, and a reworded report for 13b — before being accepted here.
# Each turns red on exactly the case that binds it and on no other.
#
# ── Strategy ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   * Hermetic. Every case builds a throwaway repository under a `mktemp -d`
#     work area removed on EXIT, and points the command under test at a
#     throwaway HOME. Nothing touches the real repo tree, the real dist/, or
#     the developer's user home. The final case asserts the real repository's
#     `git status --porcelain` is byte-identical before and after the run.
#   * Real code paths. The throwaway repository carries a copy of the shipped
#     `scripts/` tree, so `REPO_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"` — the
#     form all four manage scripts use, none of which honours a REPO_DIR
#     override — resolves to the throwaway root. The production scripts are
#     executed, never re-implemented.
#   * The relational requirement (R20's "same landing zone / same basis as the
#     assisted setup") is checked STRUCTURALLY, by parsing both scripts, never
#     by comparing the two routes' installed file sets: `install_tier_skills_to_home`
#     (setup-copilot-interactive.sh) copies only SKILL.md while `place_component`
#     (manage-copilot-component.sh) copies the whole directory, so a results
#     comparison would report a difference that is not the one under test.
#     A parse that matches nothing FAILS the case, on the precedent at
#     scripts/check-bash32-portability.sh ("refusing to pass vacuously").
#
# ── Traps this file is built around, each one measured ───────────────────────
#   1. `git diff-index --quiet HEAD` reports dirty from stat churn alone
#      immediately after a build, and goes clean after one `git status`, while
#      `git status --porcelain` is empty throughout. The R3 clean-checkout case
#      asserts `git status --porcelain` and never reaches for `diff-index`: a
#      case using it would fail for a reason unrelated to what it guards.
#   2. An empty-line append to a component source is normalised away by the
#      build. Every seeded fixture below carries real body content, so a case
#      cannot pass because its input never exercised the mechanism.
#   3. A throwaway REPO_DIR has no dist/ at all, so every tier is fresh by
#      construction and a naive fixture CANNOT fail on the staleness defect.
#      The stale-dist case therefore pre-seeds a stale tree: it builds first,
#      then adds a component without rebuilding.
#   4. Bash 3.2.57 is the enforced floor (ci/bash32-forbidden.txt). No
#      `declare -A`, no `mapfile`. This file runs under /bin/bash 3.2 and 5.x.
#   5. `scripts/lib/component-resolve.sh` — sourced by ALL FOUR commands —
#      spells out `.claude/skills`, `.gemini/skills`, `.github/skills`,
#      `.agents/skills` and `.gemini/agents` verbatim inside `installed_targets`
#      (:324-327, :347). A structural check that greps the scanned files for
#      `<cli-root>/<type>` as a bare SUBSTRING therefore matches the library
#      whatever the command declares, on every CLI. Measured: with the Gemini
#      command's `component_set_staging_roots ".gemini/skills"` mutated to
#      `".gemini/sub-skills"` — a basis diverging from the assisted setup, which
#      is exactly what R20 obliges this file to catch — the substring form still
#      reported PASS while three behavioural cases went red. Case 19 asserts the
#      ARGUMENT of the `component_set_staging_roots` call instead, which is the
#      declaration itself and cannot be satisfied by an unrelated mention.
#      THE SAME TRAP WAS LIVE A SECOND TIME, three lines below that fix, on the
#      tier set: with `COMPONENT_OVERLAY_TIERS` cut to "library community",
#      EIGHT behavioural cases went red while `grep -qw org` over the scan set
#      still SUCCEEDED, matching component-resolve.sh:9 and :300 — both comments.
#      Case 19 now reads that declaration too. Those two are the whole
#      population: the scan set is consumed by exactly two assertions in this
#      file, and both now read a declaration rather than a mention.
#   6. A NEGATIVE guard fails silently; a POSITIVE assertion cannot. Reword a
#      report and every positive assertion over it goes red at once, while a
#      negative guard simply stops matching, never fires, and the case carrying
#      it keeps reporting PASS. Both negative guards here were in that state:
#      case 2 grepped `collision|colliding|ambiguous` and case 13
#      `not found|unresolved|searched` — the REQUIREMENTS' vocabulary — while the
#      code says "claimed by more than one component" and "Locations examined",
#      so neither could ever fire. Measured: a `report_collision` call injected
#      into every unnamed install left all 23 cases green, so the regression
#      case 2's own header names was undetectable by case 2. The patterns are now
#      named constants (COLLISION_REPORT_RE, UNRESOLVED_REPORT_RE) that case 13b
#      holds to the code, so the next rewording lands as a red case rather than
#      as two guards quietly going inert.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: most cases run a command that is expected to fail,
# and a harness that aborts mid-run destroys the per-case evidence this file
# exists to produce. Every invocation goes through run()/run_stdin(), which
# capture status, stdout and stderr separately.

# --- Reporter wording, as the code emits it ----------------------------------
# The text `report_collision` and `report_unresolved`
# (scripts/lib/component-resolve.sh:262 and :230) actually print. Two NEGATIVE
# guards below fire on these, and a negative guard is the one shape of assertion
# that fails silently: when its pattern does not match what the code prints it
# never fires, and the case carrying it reports PASS forever.
#
# Both were in exactly that state. They grepped
# `collision|colliding|ambiguous` and `not found|unresolved|searched` — the
# REQUIREMENTS' vocabulary — while the code says "claimed by more than one
# component" and "Locations examined". Measured against an unlabelled capture of
# each reporter: zero of those six alternatives occurs in either output, so
# neither guard could ever fire.
#
# Naming them here is what makes the coupling assertable rather than assumed:
# case 13b calls both reporters and fails when either pattern stops matching, so
# the next rewording lands as a red case naming the pattern to update instead of
# as two guards quietly going inert.
#
# ON THE R17 VOCABULARY DRIFT. Spec 0119 R17 obliges the report to name every
# tier that was "searched"; the implementation says "Locations examined". R17 is
# satisfied on the merits — the report does name every location examined, and
# examining is the act R17 calls searching — so the code is not at fault and is
# not touched. What was wrong is keying an assertion to the spec's synonym
# instead of to the string the code emits, which is precisely how a guard goes
# inert while reading as coverage.

# Case 13b — the negative guards' patterns match the text the reporters emit.
#
# Why this case exists at all. A POSITIVE assertion over real output cannot go
# inert: reword the report and it goes red at once. A NEGATIVE guard is the
# opposite — reword the report and it stops matching, never fires, and the case
# carrying it keeps reporting PASS. That asymmetry is why the two guards at
# case 2 and case 13 were the vulnerable assertions in this file and the
# positive ones were not, and why they need a case of their own rather than
# careful authoring.
#
# The two patterns are named once (COLLISION_REPORT_RE, UNRESOLVED_REPORT_RE)
# and this case holds them to the code: both reporters are called for real and
# each pattern must match its own reporter's output. A rewording of either
# report now lands as a red case naming the pattern to update.
#
# THE CAPTURES CARRY NO LABEL, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. An earlier probe of
# this exact question reported both patterns matching, because the capture had
# been annotated with the function names `report_collision` and
# `report_unresolved` while the patterns under test contained `collision` and
# `unresolved` — the sample matched its own scaffolding. Nothing writes to these
# captures but the reporter under test; every fixture name is neutral
# (`aa-name`, `bb-name`); and the control capture below is the check that keeps
# it that way — it runs the same scaffolding with NO reporter call and fails the
# case unless it is byte-empty. Anything the harness itself contributes to a

# Case 13c — R17: a refused rebuild names every staging root it emptied, and the
# claim it makes about the rest of the tree is true.
#
# `ensure_overlay_tiers_fresh` prunes BEFORE it rebuilds, so a refused rebuild
# leaves the served staging roots emptied rather than stale. The failure branch
# therefore names every root it emptied and adds a positive claim — "the next
# rebuild that succeeds repopulates them, and nothing outside them was touched".
# A message carrying a positive claim about a destructive step is exactly the
# kind of operator-facing wording this ticket exists to stop being silent, and
# nothing asserted it: `emptied|repopulat|pruned` appeared nowhere in this suite
# and `ensure_overlay_tiers_fresh` appeared zero times. Measured: removing the
# entire pruned-roots paragraph left all 23 cases green.
#
# The assertions are deliberately not limited to the wording. Two of them bind
# the CLAIM: the pre-seeded root really is gone afterwards (so "emptied"
# describes something that happened), and two sentinels outside the pruned roots
# survive — one under the same tier's dist but a different CLI root, one in
# artifacts/ — so "nothing outside them was touched" is asserted rather than
# quoted.
#

# (CLI, type) pair whose assisted setup resolves that type from compiled output.
#
# For each pair, the setup script's declared landing zone and staging root and
# the command's are parsed and compared. A results comparison would be actively
# harmful: install_tier_skills_to_home (setup-copilot-interactive.sh) copies only
# SKILL.md while place_component (manage-copilot-component.sh) copies the whole
# directory, so the two routes' file sets differ for a reason R1/R2 do not bind.
#

# `agents` on the Gemini command. There is no fifth pair to add — the other three
# commands serve no `agents` type (see case 4c) — and no pair left out.
#
# A parse that matches nothing FAILS the case rather than passing vacuously,
# following scripts/check-bash32-portability.sh. HOME and REPO_DIR resolve to the
# sentinels <HOME> and <REPO> so the comparison is over declared intent, not over
