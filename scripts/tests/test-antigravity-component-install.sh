#!/bin/bash
# test-antigravity-component-install.sh — Regression tests for the Antigravity
# component install target, its outcome verification, and the migration away
# from the superseded placement (spec 0123, issue #761).
#
# Units under test, both in scripts/lib/common.sh:
#   install_antigravity_tier_to_home()
#   migrate_antigravity_superseded_components()
# plus the two install surfaces' call sites, asserted structurally.
#
# WHY THE HELPERS ARE SOURCED AND NOT SPAWNED. `docs/cli-matrix.md` row 10
# records that the interactive setup scripts cannot run end-to-end in CI (fzf
# prompts, the `agy` binary guard, the chroma daemon) — the same constraint that
# produced spec 0116 R17's helper. Sourcing also makes the interpreter claim
# real: the helpers then execute in THIS harness's interpreter, so launching the
# suite as `/bin/bash` genuinely exercises them at 3.2.57, where the empty-array
# trap (`"${arr[@]}"` aborts under `set -u`) lives. That trap is invisible to
# `scripts/check-bash32-portability.sh`, which is a static grep, so this runtime
# run is its only detector — and both new accumulators are empty on precisely
# the success path.
#
# Contract asserted (spec 0123):
#   R1/R2 — both kinds land under the single documented customization root.
#   R3    — the installed shape is the one the assistant accepts: directory for
#           both kinds, per the 2026-08-11 probe recorded in
#           docs/runbooks/antigravity-discovery-probe.md.
#   R4    — staged-vs-placed shortfalls are reported.
#   R5    — no `Installed` line for a component absent from the target.
#   R6    — staged some, placed none: non-zero, not a quiet pass.
#   R7    — the per-component surface targets the same root as a full run.
#   R8    — a setup run leaves no framework component at the superseded
#           placement, INCLUDING tiers the run does not install.
#   R9    — content the framework did not install is untouched.
#
# HERMETIC: no HOME writes, no network, no interactive script runs, no `agy`.
# Every path lives under a temp root removed on exit.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/tests/test-antigravity-component-install.sh

# -e intentionally omitted: the pass/fail counters drive the harness and several
# probes return non-zero on purpose.
