"""MemPalace MCP server wrapper — routes ``chromadb.PersistentClient`` to the
shared ChromaDB HTTP daemon.

Why this exists
---------------
MemPalace always instantiates ``chromadb.PersistentClient`` internally (see
``mempalace/backends/chroma.py``). When multiple MCP server processes run
concurrently they each spawn an independent Rust HNSW compactor against the
same on-disk index, corrupting the shared binary files.

Solution: a single ``chroma run`` HTTP daemon owns the index, and every
MCP server connects via ``HttpClient``. This wrapper monkey-patches the
``PersistentClient`` symbol **before** ``mempalace`` is imported, then hands
off to the regular MCP entrypoint.

Configuration
-------------
- ``MEMPALACE_CHROMA_HOST`` (default ``127.0.0.1``) — daemon host (loopback only).
- ``MEMPALACE_CHROMA_PORT`` (default ``8001``) — daemon port.
- ``MEMPALACE_CHROMA_MAX_CONNECTIONS`` (default ``8``) — ceiling on the total
  number of connections this session holds open against the daemon.
- ``MEMPALACE_CHROMA_MAX_KEEPALIVE_CONNECTIONS`` (default ``4``) — ceiling on
  the number of idle keep-alive connections retained between requests.

If the daemon is unreachable at startup we ``exit 1`` with the installer
command on stderr. Silent fallback to ``PersistentClient`` is forbidden by
design — it would re-introduce the corruption bug.

Runtime version guard (spec 0108)
---------------------------------
An out-of-range MemPalace is the same class of unmet precondition as an
unreachable daemon and is treated the same way: this process determines, before
it begins serving, the MemPalace version *its own interpreter* resolves, and
refuses to serve when that version lies outside the range pinned in
``scripts/lib/common.sh``. Two independent gates, both of which must pass:

- **Phase A** (Step 1, before ``chromadb`` is even imported) range-checks
  ``importlib.metadata.version("mempalace")`` — the in-process resolution, the
  same machinery an ``import`` in this process would use.
- **Phase B** (Step 4, after ``mempalace`` is imported) range-checks
  ``mempalace.__version__`` independently. It is *not* compared for equality
  with the Phase A value: ``mempalace/version.py`` is a hand-maintained literal,
  structurally independent of the dist-info field, so a ``.postN`` rebuild
  legitimately disagrees with both values in range. Such disagreement is
  reported by ``scripts/doctor-mempalace.sh``, never refused here.

# ── Step 0: orphan self-reap watchdog (spec 0029 R5) ─────────────────────────
# An MCP stdio server normally exits on stdin EOF: ``mempalace.mcp_server.main()``
# loops on ``sys.stdin.readline()`` and breaks when it returns empty, which the
# OS then releases the daemon-side ``HttpClient`` sockets for (sockets close on
# process exit). That covers the common case where the parent agent session dies
# and closes the write-end of the stdin pipe. But if the parent dies while some
# other process keeps that pipe's write-end open, stdin never EOFs and the
# orphaned wrapper lingers, holding its daemon connection open indefinitely —
# the exact leak R5 forbids. This watchdog is a belt-and-suspenders guard for
# that case: it polls ``os.getppid()`` and self-terminates when the parent is
# reaped (reparented to PID 1 = orphaned). It deliberately does NOT read stdin,
# so it cannot steal JSON-RPC bytes that ``main()`` owns. It uses ``os._exit``,
# not ``sys.exit``: ``sys.exit`` only raises ``SystemExit`` in its own thread
# and would not terminate the process from this daemon thread (cold-review
# finding #2).

# died, and calls os._exit(0) — every poll interval, forever. Observed in
# production as 172 clean restarts before an operator noticed, with no error in
# the log because os._exit runs no handler (issue #749).
#
# Under HTTP there is also nothing left for it to protect: the leak it guards
# is a wrapper whose stdin never EOFs because the parent died holding the pipe.
# An HTTP daemon has no stdin pipe and no parent session — its lifetime belongs
