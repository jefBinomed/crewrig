// --- Base-branch status invariant (spec 0109) -------------------------------
// The helpers below give the linter the one thing it previously lacked: a view
// of the change's base branch. They exist to answer a single question — is this
// spec file already present on the base branch? — because that is the
// discriminator spec 0109 R2 names: a spec the change under test introduces is
// legitimately `draft` until its own merge mechanic flips it, while a spec
// already on the base branch carrying `draft` is the contradiction R1 forbids.

// gitCwd — the directory every git invocation in this file runs in, assigned once
// the work tree has been located (see resolveBaseContext). It enforces one
// invariant: **git in this file runs at the repository root** (spec 0109
// delta-03 R14).
//
// A default rather than an argument at each call site, because R15 requires the
// mechanism to be structural. The defect delta-03 fixes existed precisely
// because two path-sensitive invocations — `ls-tree`'s pathspecs and `diff`'s
// output paths — were each written without their author classifying them as
// path-sensitive; from a subdirectory the first returned an empty set and the
// check reported `Linting passed!` on a live violation. A remedy that depends on
// that classification being made correctly next time does not remove the failure
// mode. As a default, an invocation added later inherits the guarantee without
// having to know it exists.
//
// One invocation is necessarily exempt: the one that DISCOVERS the work tree runs
// while this is still `null`, so it resolves against the caller's directory —
// which is what lets it answer which repository the run is about. Pinning it
// would be circular.

//      failed to inspect. This is the tarball/temp-fixture case, never CI —
//      every CI checkout is a git repository.
//   2. Inside a repository, base ref resolves → ENFORCE.
//   3. Inside a repository, base ref does NOT resolve → hard error, exit 2.
//      Fail closed: a repository whose base cannot be resolved is a wiring

//      green would restore the "green does not mean checked" defect that spec
//      0109 exists to remove.
//

//      linter through `task spec:lint`, and Task collapses ANY non-zero command
//      status into its own 201 (measured on Task 3.50.0) — so downstream of the
//      wrapper the two outcomes are indistinguishable by exit code, and the
//      `[ERROR]` line below is what names the fault in the pipeline log. This is
//      unlike check-skill-versions.sh, whose exit 2 does propagate because
