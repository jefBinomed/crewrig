#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/lib/gemini-settings.sh — the in-place merge of ~/.gemini/settings.json
# (spec 0214). Sourced by setup-gemini-interactive.sh AFTER scripts/lib/common.sh
# (it uses backup_file, MCP_RESERVED_NAMES, merge_preexisting_mcp_servers,
# apply_org_mcp_servers and write_json_config_secure). Do NOT execute directly.
#
# The setup no longer rebuilds the file from config/gemini/settings.json. It
# reads the existing file once, the way Gemini CLI reads it
# (`JSON.parse(stripJsonComments(...))`), and merges it with the template:
#   - framework-owned (R1): the `context.fileName` list — the ordered union of
#     the template's list and the operator's (R6, R7) — and the reserved MCP
#     entries of spec 0089 R1, rebuilt whole from the template on every run, so
#     the spec 0084 TLS wrapper is applied exactly once (R8, R9);
#   - every other template key is a seed (R2): written only when absent and
#     every ancestor is absent or an object; an operator value always wins;
#   - everything else — hooks included — is operator content, kept as it is
#     (R3, R16).
# The merged snapshot is renamed over the target at 0600 before anything else
# reads it, so every later reader (the 0089 / 0091 folds, ensure_mempalace_http,
# merge_session_recording_hooks, the usage_capture_* readers) sees plain JSON.
#
# Contracts shared by every function below:
#   - Failure contract. A function returns non-zero on failure and never calls
#     `exit`. The setup calls gemini_settings_write from a `||` context, where
#     bash suspends errexit INSIDE the function too, so each fallible command is
#     checked explicitly.
#   - jq only. The setup requires jq and nothing else for this path.
#   - No secret on argv. The existing file can hold the MemPalace bearer token
#     (register_mempalace_mcp), so its content only ever reaches jq as input or
#     through --slurpfile. The reserved values are redacted to `{}` before the
#     MCP server map is handed to the 0089 / 0091 helpers, and those helpers'
#     own internals (issue #1248) now also route this data through
#     --slurpfile from a private 0600 temp file — never --argjson — writing
#     the result through write_json_config_secure, so nothing they touch
#     reaches jq's argv either.
#   - Owner-only. gemini_settings_write runs under umask 077 and ends with the
#     target at 0600 (R13).
#
# All JSON work happens in jq, through the one definitions string below.

# JSONC comment removal, the strip-json-comments semantics Gemini CLI uses.
# One left-to-right scan: a string literal is matched whole and put back
# unchanged, so `//`, `/*` and an escaped quote inside a string are never read
# as a comment; a line comment runs to the end of its line; a block comment
# runs to its `*/`, or to the end of the text when it is never closed. Each
# comment becomes ONE SPACE, never the empty string, so the tokens on either
# side are not joined (`1/**/2` stays two tokens and is rejected, as
# JSON.parse rejects it). A string never closed runs to the end of the text,
# as it does in strip-json-comments, where nothing after it is a comment. No
# alternative can match the empty string, and every loop is possessive, with
# alternatives that start on distinct characters: no match ever backtracks
# (an adversarial run of escaped quotes took seconds with a backtracking loop).
# The kept branch spans whole runs of non-comment text, so gsub (~0.5 ms a match)
# pays per comment, not per string; known limit: comments every few bytes stay slow.

# JSON.parse grammar check of text that jq already parsed. jq accepts literals
# JSON.parse rejects (`01`, `+1`, `.5`, `1.`, `Infinity`, `NaN`, `nan`), and
# would silently change their values, so a text passes only when it is, token
# for token, strict JSON: string literals, structural characters, JSON
# whitespace, `true` / `false` / `null`, and numbers of the JSON grammar
# `-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?` ending at a token boundary.
# One anchored `test`, every alternative starting on a distinct character and
