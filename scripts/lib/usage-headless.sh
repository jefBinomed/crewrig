# usage-headless.sh — headless usage capture for a framework-owned,
# non-interactive CLI launch (spec 0206 PLAN v3 step 15). Three call shapes,
# because the four CLIs' own structured-output affordances are NOT uniform:
#
#   usage_headless_run <cli> -- <args…>
#     For a CLI whose own stdout, once --output-format json (or equivalent)
#     is added to <args…>, both IS the structured envelope AND is meant to
#     be consumed as such by the caller (a framework launch site that
#     already wants the JSON). Forwards stdout unchanged; derives one
#     run-total record from it.
#
#   usage_headless_capture_usage_file <cli> <usage_output_file> <launch_instant>
#     For a CLI whose structured summary lands in a SEPARATE file via its
#     own side-channel flag (Copilot CLI's --usage-output-file) rather than
#     stdout — verified live (DEV follow-up, issue #1169) to leave the
#     wrapped command's own stdout/stderr completely unaffected. Call this
#     AFTER the wrapped invocation completes; it never touches the
#     invocation's own output streams.
#
#   usage_headless_agy_rewrite_json_response <out_file> <launch_instant>
#     For Antigravity CLI specifically: `agy` has no side-channel flag —
#     --output-format json changes what lands on stdout. Call sites that
#     need PLAIN TEXT on stdout (not JSON) must instead run
#     `agy ... --output-format json` themselves, capture that JSON into
#     <out_file>, then call this function, which derives one run-total
#     record from <out_file> and REWRITES it to hold exactly the JSON
#     envelope's own `.response` field — verified live, byte-identical to
#     what `agy ...` (plain text mode) would have written directly, on two
#     distinct prompts on this machine (a one-word reply and a 58-line tool
#     listing). A parse failure (a timeout truncated the file, or agy wrote
#     a non-JSON error) leaves <out_file> COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED — a caller's
#     own empty/error classification downstream sees exactly what it would
#     have without this wrapping. The rewrite happens in place: the reply is
#     never staged in a second temp file, so the caller's own <out_file> is
#     the only file that ever holds it.
#
# All three resolve CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT (default ${HOME}/.crewrig/usage) AT
# CALL TIME — before any per-invocation `HOME=` override the caller applies
# to the CLI itself. Load-bearing: scripts/probe-extension-mcp-token.sh runs
# Copilot CLI under HOME="$isolated_home", and a record resolved after that
# override would be written inside a throwaway home and deleted with it.
#
# Usage (source this file, then call a function):
#   # shellcheck source=scripts/lib/usage-headless.sh
#   . "$REPO_DIR/scripts/lib/usage-headless.sh"
#
# Usage capture NEVER fails or blocks the wrapped run (same R15 contract as
# hooks/usage-capture.sh — a capture failure is swallowed, never surfaced).
# A wrapped run's own exit status is always preserved and returned unchanged.

# _usage_headless_submit_envelope_file <cli> <envelope_json_file> <launch_instant>
#
# Shared internal primitive: derives one run-total record from an
# already-written JSON envelope file via
# scripts/lib/usage-capture/adapters/headless-envelope.js and submits it.
# Written to a temp .js file rather than passed inline via `node -e`: the
# single-quoted-inside-single-quoted fragility that embedding carries (an
# apostrophe in a comment breaks the outer bash quoting) is not worth the
# risk here.
