# The release engine is semantic-release on BOTH forges. What this file decides

# it releases from, which identity and credential the engine sees, and the
# generated `.releaserc.json`. That config is composed of three parts:
#
#   (a) the shared core — analyzer, changelog, exec prepareCmd, git. Identical
#       on both forges and semantically identical to the pre-spec heredoc
#       (golden: scripts/tests/fixtures/release/github-releaserc.golden.json);
#   (b) the forge notes leg — EMPTY on GitHub, so GitHub notes stay byte for
#       byte what they were (R21). On GitLab it overrides gitmoji's note
#       template, its commit partial and its issue-link template with links
#       built from CI_PROJECT_URL / CI_SERVER_URL (R20);
#   (c) the forge publish leg — @semantic-release/github or
#       @semantic-release/gitlab, present in publish mode only.
#
# Every refusal below exits 2 before any file is written or any engine call is
# made (R10), and names what it refused — a credential is only ever named,
# never printed (R11).

# LOCKSTEP ORDERING (spec 0044): @semantic-release/exec MUST precede
# @semantic-release/git in the plugin array. semantic-release runs each release
# step's plugins in array order, so exec.prepareCmd (which rewrites the two
# sibling manifests, then packages the release artifact from the rewritten
# tree) runs BEFORE git.prepare (which stages + commits the assets). If git ran
# first, the synced siblings would miss the release commit and re-introduce the
# divergence check-extension-manifest-version.sh forbids — and the package step
# would run against a tree not yet carrying its own release version. The
# `[skip ci]` token in the GitLab publish `message` MUST be preserved: it is
# what stops the release commit, pushed to the release branch with a token
# that DOES trigger pipelines there, from re-triggering the build pipeline
# (and the divergence guard) — do not drop it when editing this config.
#
# GitHub release-PR flow (issue #1379). The `main-protected` ruleset requires
# the `ratchet` and `lint-typescript` checks, so no commit can be pushed to the
# release branch from the runner. The GitHub legs therefore split in two:
#   - `prepare` runs in the throwaway clone (scripts/monorepo-release.sh):
#     changelog, manifest sync (release_sync_cmd, no packaging) and the git
#     commit — whose message carries NO `[skip ci]`: the commit reaches `main`
#     only through the release PR, and a `[skip ci]` head commit (rebase merge,
#     or the squash message of a one-commit PR) would suppress the very
#     release workflow run that publishes it. No publish leg.
#   - `publish` runs in the checkout once that PR is merged: the committed
#     manifests already carry the version, so there is no changelog and no git
#     step — the engine only packages, tags the merged commit, pushes the tag
#     (never a branch) and creates the forge release.
#
# The gitmoji plugin is referenced through its ESM facade
# scripts/lib/release-notes/gitmoji-esm-shim.mjs (issue #1225):
# semantic-release-monorepo resolves wrapped steps with `import()`, which sees
# only `analyzeCommits` on the CommonJS package, so the bare package name left
# every note empty. As in #1225, the facade's absolute path is resolved from
# this library's own location (wrapStep imports the name verbatim), not from
# <root>, so a driver run against another checkout still finds it. Both legs
# and both modes use the facade, so the GitHub note R21 freezes is the one it
# renders; the rehearsal clone is at the same commit, so its facade is the same
# file.
#
# The changelog step is likewise referenced through a facade,
# scripts/lib/release-notes/changelog-plugin.ts (issue #1364), resolved from
# this library's own location: it writes CHANGELOG.md through the real
# @semantic-release/changelog, but with the note normalised to be lint-safe
# under a single `# Changelog` title, and lints the file with the repository's
# .markdownlintrc before @semantic-release/git commits it — the `[skip ci]`
# release commit is never linted by CI, so that check has to happen here. The
# release note itself (forge body, commit message) is not touched.
#
# No `gemini-extension.json` arm in prepareCmd: it is a BUILD OUTPUT under the
# render-at-publication model (spec 0173 delta-01), never a committed sibling.
#
# Publish leg: github uploads the ONE archive under its historical label;
# gitlab uploads it to the generic package registry WITHOUT a label, so the
# uploaded file name is the archive's own basename <ext>-<version>.tar.gz
# (plan v1-F4). The path is a glob because the version-bearing file name is
# only known once nextRelease.version is computed.
