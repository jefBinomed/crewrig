#!/bin/bash
# component-resolve.sh — Overlay-tier component resolution shared by the four
# per-component install commands and by the build's collision pre-pass
# (spec 0119).
#
# ── What this library exists to remove ───────────────────────────────────────
# Before it, each `scripts/manage-*-component.sh` resolved a component by taking
# the FIRST existing source root and stopping. Which tiers were populated
# therefore decided which tiers were reachable: a component in `org` became
# invisible the moment `community` existed, and the resulting message blamed a
# missing build rather than the tier the operator asked for. Every function here
# searches every served root, collects every match, and reports a genuine miss
# as a miss — naming the tiers examined, never a cause that was not established.
#
# ── The exit-status contract, and why it is load-bearing ─────────────────────
# `resolve_component_in_roots`, `enumerate_components_in_roots`,
# `report_unresolved`, `report_collision` and `installed_targets` return **0 in
# every non-fatal case** and carry their answer on stdout. Absence is the empty
# string, never a non-zero status.
#
# That is not a stylistic preference. Every caller runs `set -e`
# (manage-claude-component.sh, manage-copilot-component.sh,
# manage-workspace-component.sh, manage-antigravity-component.sh;
# build-components.sh adds `-uo pipefail`). Under `set -e`, `x=$(f)` where `f`
# returns 1 aborts the script before the next line AND discards f's stdout into
# the unread variable — byte-for-byte the silent failure this ticket exists to
# remove. A resolver that signalled "not found" by returning 1 would reintroduce
# it at every call site.
#
# `ensure_overlay_tiers_fresh` is the one exception, and it is deliberate: it is
# the only function here that can legitimately fail, so it RETURNS THE BUILD'S
# STATUS and its caller tests that status explicitly. See its own header.
#
# ── Bash 3.2.57 is the floor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `/bin/bash` on stock macOS is 3.2.57 and `ci/bash32-forbidden.txt` is enforced
# in CI. No `declare -A`, no `mapfile`. Two 3.2-specific traps are worked around
# in place:
#   * 3.2 does not make an earlier name visible to a later initialiser in the
#     SAME `local`, so `local a="$1" b="$WORK/$a"` aborts with `a: unbound
#     variable`. Every declaration below is split.
#   * `${arr[@]}` on an empty array trips `set -u`, so array expansions use the
#     `${a[@]+"${a[@]}"}` guard (the form already used at
#     scripts/check-test-wiring.sh).
#
# ── Precondition ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The sourcing script must have defined REPO_DIR. Every path this library builds
# hangs off it, and `${REPO_DIR:?}` fails loudly rather than composing a path
# rooted at `/`.

# The overlay tiers every per-component command serves, in resolution order.
# `core` is deliberately absent: its landing zone is the committed project tree
# and its delivery is the build, not an install (spec 0119 R6).

# --- Installed-target derivation (the build's R13 pre-pass) ------------------

# installed_targets <artifacts-dir> — one
# `<tier-class><TAB><install-target><TAB><tier><TAB><kind>` record per target
# every component of every tier would be installed to.
#
# THE KEY IS (tier-class, install-target), NOT the name. R12 makes two
# components collide only where they would be installed under the same name
# into the SAME landing zone: `architect` legitimately exists as both a skill
# and an agent, and `core` legitimately shares names with an overlay tier
# because `core` lands in the committed project tree while every overlay tier
# lands in the user home. Measured against this repository: 172 installed
# targets, ZERO duplicates keyed on (tier-class, install-target) and NINE keyed
# on name alone.
#
# The type partition is pinned on two orthogonal axes:
#   * Axis A — compiled by the build: skills, commands, agents. Keys are the
#     build's own output paths, so the guard covers exactly what it produces.
#     Note that three of four CLIs compile a COMMAND into the SKILLS namespace
#     (.claude/skills/<n>, .github/skills/<n>, .agents/skills/<n>), which is why
#     a command and a skill sharing one name is a collision.
#   * Axis B — read from artifacts/ by a manage command: policies, hooks,
#     themes, mcp-servers. A guard scoped to build output could not reach these
#     at all, and R15 would be a permanent dead end for them.
# `commands` sits in both; it is keyed from axis A only, so a library-versus-org
# command-name collision is reported once. The stated consequence:
# `~/.gemini/commands/<n>.md` — what the Gemini command installs today — is not
# guarded, because it is not a target the build produces.

# --- Staging freshness -------------------------------------------------------

# ensure_overlay_tiers_fresh <cli> <tier>... — prune then rebuild the served
# overlay staging roots of <cli>. RETURNS THE BUILD'S STATUS.
#
# It prunes as well as rebuilds because the build adds and never removes
# (`grep -n 'rm -rf' build-components.sh` finds one hit, the check-mode staging
# root). A component renamed or deleted under artifacts/ otherwise leaves its
# compiled copy behind, so an unnamed request installs a component no served
# tier holds — and if that residue shares a name with a live component, R15
# refuses that name permanently against a "source" that is only build residue,
# which no report can distinguish and no write-only rebuild can clear.
#
# It touches nothing outside `dist/<tier>/<cli-root>`. `output_root_for_tier`
# routes `core` to $REPO_DIR and every other tier to $REPO_DIR/dist/$tier, and
# `.gitignore` carries `dist/` — so an install command triggered on a branch
# carrying an unbuilt `core` source edit leaves the committed tree exactly as it
# found it, which a full-tier rebuild would not.
#
# EXIT CONTRACT. This is the one function here that can legitimately fail, so it
# is the one that returns a status instead of an answer. A non-zero is fatal and
# reported AS ITSELF, with the build's own output: after the R13 pre-pass the
# build carries a refusal whose whole purpose is to exit non-zero on a
# collision, and emitting "not resolved, examined 3 roots" when the established
# cause is a refused build would name a cause that was not established (R17).
#
# THE REFUSAL NAMES THE PRUNE. The prune happens BEFORE the build runs, so a
# refused build leaves the staging roots emptied rather than stale. Saying only
# "nothing has been installed" is true and still leaves the operator holding an
# emptied staging tree with no idea it happened — a confusing state produced by
# this function and reported by nobody. The failure branch therefore names every
# root it emptied and says the next successful rebuild repopulates them, which

# That per-NAME refusal, rather than a per-REQUEST one, is the only reading that
# satisfies R9 and R15 at once: R15's waiver is "Notwithstanding requirement 7",
# it names no other requirement, and its object is "any component under THAT
# name" — while R9 obliges the unnamed request to install every component of the
# type from every served tier.
#
# Here the rebuild fires FIRST, before enumeration, and unconditionally: a stale
# or residual tree mis-enumerates silently, which R9 forbids, and there is no
# miss to trigger on.
