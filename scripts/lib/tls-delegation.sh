# (spec 0084). Sourced by the four setup-*-interactive.sh flows. Do NOT
# execute directly.
#
# Detects, deterministically, whether the environment appears to require custom
# certificate trust, and — only on explicit consent — records standard,
# tool-native trust variables to a single per-user managed file
# (~/.crewrig/tls-env.sh) that the runtime wrapper (scripts/lib/tls-exec.sh)
# and the framework's launch paths source. It NEVER edits the user's shell
# profile or global tool configuration in place, and NEVER emits a setting that
# disables or weakens certificate verification (spec 0084 R3/R5/R6/R11).

# _tls_candidate_ca — echo the resolved custom-CA bundle path, or nothing.
# Resolution order (first hit wins), all deterministic:
#   1. an already-set standard cert env var (reuse the user's own value);
#   2. an explicit CREWRIG_TLS_CA / TLS_DELEGATION_CA override;
#   3. the OS consolidated trust bundle (Linux ca-certificates / RHEL bundle;
#      macOS /etc/ssl/cert.pem).
