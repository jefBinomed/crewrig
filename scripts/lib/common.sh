# is narrowed the same way first, so backups an older release left at 0644 stop

# --- MCP reserved (framework-managed) server names (spec 0089 R1) ------------
# The single source of truth for the names the framework owns. A declaration
# found under one of these names is framework-managed, never an operator
# declaration: it is written by the framework on selection (R7, framework wins)
# and absent on decline (R8). Every other MCP server name is an operator
# declaration and is preserved verbatim across a setup run (R2/R3).
MCP_RESERVED_NAMES=(mempalace sequentialthinking)

# merge_preexisting_mcp_servers <pre_run_mcpservers_json> <framework_config_path> <backup_ref>
#
# Folds an operator's pre-existing MCP server declarations back into a
# freshly-written framework MCP config so custom (non-reserved) servers survive
# a setup run (spec 0089). The two overwrite-based setups (Copilot, Antigravity)
# call this ONE helper right after their template write. Gemini merges
# settings.json in place (spec 0214) and calls it from gemini_settings_write
# (scripts/lib/gemini-settings.sh) after that merge, where the fold is a content
# no-op and the helper supplies the R9 warnings. One helper for all three is
# what keeps them symmetric (R5) and is the only shape R11's hermetic test can
# exercise without fzf / the `agy` guard / the chroma daemon.
#
# Policy (all owned here):
#   R2/R3/R4 — every non-reserved pre-existing server is merged back VERBATIM
#     and wins over any same-named framework entry (right-biased jq object
#     merge: `.mcpServers + $preserved`).
#   R7 — a framework reserved server selected during the run keeps its own name:
#     reserved names are stripped from the operator side before the merge, so
#     the framework entry cannot be overwritten (framework wins on selection).
#   R8 — a declined reserved server is absent from BOTH operands (the framework
#     write removed it, `$preserved` stripped it), so the result has no entry
#     under that name (decline toggle-off preserved).
#   R9 — each reserved-name collision in the pre-run config emits a non-silent
#     warning naming the server and pointing at <backup_ref>, worded for the
#     replacement (framework kept the name) or the removal (framework declined).
#   R6 — the framework's reserved entries were TLS-wrapped (spec 0084) BEFORE
#     this fold and are never in the operator side, so their wrapping survives.
#
# Args:
#   $1 pre_run_mcpservers_json — the target's `.mcpServers` captured BEFORE the
#      framework write (a JSON object; "" or "{}" when none pre-existed).
#   $2 framework_config_path   — the just-written framework config; rewritten in
#      place (atomic tmp + mv).

# --- Org-declared MCP servers (spec 0091) ------------------------------------
# A THIRD precedence layer folded on top of the spec-0089 operator merge, wired

# org-owned root manifest `mcp-servers.org.json` declares servers in a small
# neutral schema keyed by name; the three file CLIs (Gemini/Copilot/Antigravity)
# translate it into their native `mcpServers` shape and fold it AFTER the 0089
# merge, while Claude iterates the same manifest and issues one `claude mcp add`
# per entry. Resolved precedence on every CLI:
#     framework-reserved  >  org  >  operator-pre-existing
# R10 — reserved names (mempalace / sequentialthinking) stay framework-managed:
#   an org declaration under a reserved name is NOT applied, with a non-silent
#   warning (framework wins). R11 — a non-reserved org name that collides with
#   an operator's pre-existing entry wins, with a non-silent warning naming it.
# The 0089 helper (merge_preexisting_mcp_servers) above is deliberately left
# untouched; these are siblings folded strictly after it.

# read_org_mcp_manifest <manifest_path>

# empty, unparseable, or `.mcpServers` is not an object — degrade, never abort,

# widened by spec 0180 to name Claude explicitly: the default arm already
# emitted Claude's evidenced shapes byte-for-byte, so no branch logic changes
# with this fourth label, only the contract comment below). Emits the native
# JSON object on STDOUT only (safe for command substitution); any capability
# warning goes to STDERR.
#
# Grounded native shapes (verified against each CLI's own `mcp add`, temp HOME):
#   stdio  gemini/antigravity/claude -> {command, args?, env?}   (no "type")
#          copilot                   -> {type:"stdio", command, args?, env?}
#          (copilot's own `mcp add` writes "type":"local"; the shipped template
#           and the live mempalace/seqthink entries use "type":"stdio", so we
#           match the framework's proven convention.)
#   http/  copilot/claude     -> {type:<transport>, url, headers?}
#   sse    antigravity        -> {serverUrl, headers?}   (NOTE: Antigravity's
#          remote-entry key is `serverUrl`, NOT `url`, and carries no transport
#          `type` field — one shape covers both http and Streamable-HTTP/SSE.
#          Grounded against the official Antigravity MCP docs
#          (https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp#mcp-configuration-structure):
#          file `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, stdio {command,args,env,cwd?}

#          spec 0054 §Open questions that the mcp_config.json format is "not
#          publicly documented" — the format is now officially documented, so
#          the earlier remote-transport gap-acceptance is closed. Auth extras
#          (authProviderType/oauth) are out of scope for this base declaration.)
#          gemini              -> {httpUrl, headers?} (http) | {url, headers?}
#          (sse) — no `type`/`transport` key at all; Gemini infers the
#          transport from WHICH key is present. Grounded against gemini-cli
#          0.46.0's own schema (bundle/docs/tools/mcp-server.md — "Required
#          (one of the following)": `command` (Stdio), `url` (SSE), `httpUrl`
#          (HTTP streaming); no `type`/`transport` key anywhere in the
#          documented schema). This REPAIRS a live defect (spec 0180 PLAN v5
#          step 4, maintainer arbitration 2026-08-25): the prior fall-through
#          emitted Copilot/Claude's `{type:"http", url}` shape for Gemini too,
#          which lands a declared `http` server on Gemini's SSE transport
#          instead of Streamable HTTP. The stale claim this propagated from

# install_chroma_daemon <repo_dir>
#
# Installs and starts the shared ChromaDB HTTP daemon supervisor (issue #98,
# ADR 0006). Idempotent — re-running on an already-loaded unit is a no-op.
#
# On macOS: copies config/launchd/com.mempalace.chroma-server.plist to
#           ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and loads it via launchctl.
# On Linux: copies config/systemd/mempalace-chroma-server.service to
#           ~/.config/systemd/user/ and enables+starts it via systemctl --user.
#
# After install, runs scripts/status-chroma-server.sh to confirm the daemon
# is healthy before returning. Exits 1 if the daemon fails to come up — the
# wrapper's fail-loud contract requires the daemon to be reachable before
# any MCP entry is registered.
# install_daemon_supervisor <launchd_label> <systemd_unit> <materialise_fn> <health_fn> <log_hint>
#
# Installs and starts a supervised user-level daemon. Idempotent — re-running
# on an already-loaded unit is a no-op.
#
#   <launchd_label>  launchd label, and the basename of the plist under
#                    config/launchd/ (e.g. com.mempalace.chroma-server)
#   <systemd_unit>   systemd unit name, and the basename of the unit file under
#                    config/systemd/ (e.g. mempalace-chroma-server). The two
#                    naming schemes genuinely differ — reverse-DNS on macOS,
#                    hyphenated on Linux — so they are separate parameters
#                    rather than one derived from the other.
#   <materialise_fn> name of a function taking <src> <dst>; writes the
#                    substituted unit and returns non-zero on refusal. Every
#                    placeholder set is daemon-specific — Chroma needs the
#                    chroma binary, the MCP daemon needs a port and a token —
#                    so substitution is the caller's, not this function's.
#   <health_fn>      name of a function returning 0 once the daemon serves.
#                    Polled on a deadline; a supervised process needs a few
#                    seconds to bind its socket (issue #138).
#   <log_hint>       path shown to the operator when the deadline expires.
#
# Generalised from install_chroma_daemon by spec 0113. The three parts that

# daemon the default outcome of a setup run (spec 0113 delta-02, R17-R20),
# replacing the opt-in offer_mcp_http_switch.
#
# Call each setup script's instance AFTER the stdio-shaped write it must
# survive: `mempalace` is in MCP_RESERVED_NAMES, so neither
# merge_preexisting_mcp_servers nor the Gemini in-place merge (spec 0214)
# preserves a prior entry under that name, and the framework write that
# replaces it is stdio-shaped. Running the helper after that write lets its
# HTTP registration replace the stdio entry instead of being clobbered by it.
#
# Probe-first flow (R18): the "is the daemon actually serving" decision is
# made with the positive authenticated accept probe `_mcp_daemon_probe_accepts`
# — NEVER with /healthz (`_health_mcp_daemon`), whose endpoint is
# require_auth=False and answers 200 in every state, satisfied by a stale
# process and therefore green for exactly the wrong reason (the rationale for
# retiring it as a serving predicate: spec 0139 delta-01 / issue #880). The
# token is read tolerantly BEFORE the probe — a token failure must never abort
# before the probe, because converging stdio against a daemon that would have
# answered is exactly the lockout R20 forbids; an unreadable token probes with
# a placeholder bearer instead (a serving daemon answers 401, a dead one
# nothing).
#
# Exit contract:
#   0 — the HTTP entry is registered;
#   1 — no usable serving daemon exists (R19 trigger): the probe never
#       accepted, the supervisor install failed, or the token was never
#       provisionable — the caller restores the previous (stdio) arrangement;
#   2 — the daemon is probe-verified serving but the registration could not
#       be completed: the register write failed, or the accepting probe ran
#       on the placeholder bearer because no readable token exists (e.g. an
#       unauthenticated impostor answering on the port). Converging stdio
#       against a daemon whose serving-ness is proven would violate R20, so
#       the caller keeps the existing entry and reports.
#

# file (spec 0080 R15/R16, delta-01). The `user-validate` skill reads this file
# at gate time to decide how to realise a validation gate.
#
# Two drive paths:
#   Interactive (default) — fzf prompts, mirroring the opt-in toggles elsewhere
#     in these scripts (e.g. INSTALL_SEQTHINK).
#   Non-interactive (hermetic CI) — when ANY of VALIDATION_BACKEND,
#     VALIDATION_TRANSLATE, VALIDATION_PEDAGOGY, or VALIDATION_ILLUSTRATION is
#     set, the fzf prompts are bypassed and values are taken from the
#     environment (each unset variable falls back to its documented default).
#     This is the surface the CI test drives.
#
# Enum contract (an invalid value fails loudly — load-bearing in the
# non-interactive path):

#
# deploy_antigravity_transcript_hooks <manifest_src> <hook_src> <hooks_dir> <manifest_target> <env_prefix> <guard_src>
#
# Why this is a helper rather than an inline block like its three siblings:
# `scripts/tests/test-setup-mcp-merge.sh` records the house rule that the
# interactive setup scripts cannot run end-to-end in CI (fzf prompts, the `agy`
# guard, the chroma daemon). Spec 0116 R17 requires hermetic coverage of the
# deployment, so the deployment has to live somewhere a test can call. The two
# `fzf` prompts stay in the setup script and are asserted structurally.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. installs the shared hook script under the assistant's own directory, so
#      the deployed hook stops depending on this repository's path (R13);
#   2. rewrites every command in the manifest by named-hook dispatch (spec 0116
#      delta-03 R28):
#      - under `crewrig-mempalace-transcript`, every command names the installed
#        absolute path, prefixed with `$env_prefix`, and appends the lifecycle
#        event name (R14, and R5 — the Antigravity payload carries no event
#        name, so the manifest must say which event fired);
#      - under `crewrig-worktree-git-guard`, the command names the absolute
#        REPOSITORY path of the guard (never installed), with NO env prefix and
#        NO event argument — the guard inspects the payload it reads from stdin,
#        and it delegates claim validation to `scripts/worktree-claim.sh`
#        relative to the repo, so an installed copy would break that chain;
#   3. backs up an existing manifest before touching it (R15) and MERGES into
#      it rather than overwriting: `hooks.json`'s top level is a map of NAMED
#      hooks and the operator may own others. Same-named hooks are replaced,
#      which is what re-running setup should do.
#
# The rewrite uses `with_entries`, not the `map` the sibling setups use, for two
# reasons: the event name is a KEY here rather than a field, and a named hook may
# carry a non-array `enabled` member that must be passed through untouched.

#
# WHY THESE LIVE HERE AND NOT INLINE. `docs/cli-matrix.md` row 10 records that
# the interactive setup scripts cannot run end-to-end in CI — `fzf` prompts, the
# `agy` binary guard, the chroma daemon. Spec 0116 R17 moved the transcript-hook
# deployment into this file for exactly that reason, and the same constraint
# applies to placement, verification and migration: the code that has to be
# hermetically tested must be callable, so `scripts/tests/*.sh` can `source` it
# and the `fzf` prompts are asserted structurally instead.

#
# THE PREDICATE IS A CONJUNCTION, and both halves are load-bearing:
#   1. the on-disk name is one the framework serves, AND
#   2. that component's own frontmatter carries `metadata.provenance.canonical`.
# Names like `user-validate`, `developer`, `tester` and `architect` are entirely
# plausible names for a directory a user created themselves; a degraded
# predicate that keeps only half of this destroys user content. Anything failing
# either half is left alone, and a leftover that carries provenance but matches
# no served name is REPORTED by name with its removal command rather than
# removed — a component the framework once installed and has since deleted, or
# moved out of a served tier, is the one accepted failure mode here.
#
# `<artifacts_root>` is an ARGUMENT rather than a constant resolved from
# `$REPO_DIR` so the org-orphan case can be tested hermetically: this repository
# ships `artifacts/org/skills/` and `artifacts/community/skills/` empty.
#
# With explicit names the sweep is narrowed to them — the per-component install
# surface needs only enough cleanup to keep R7's placement property true for the
# component it just touched; R8 binds a setup run.
