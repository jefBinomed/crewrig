#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build-extension.sh — The single render entry point for the generic extension
# declaration model (spec 0173, as amended by
# specs/0173-extension-declaration-model.delta-01.md).
#
# Walks an extension's declarations in `extension.json` and produces every
# CLI-native file for all four supported command-line tools. NOTHING
# generated is committed on the primary branch (0173Δ R7): every output lands
# in a build directory outside the committed source tree.
#
#   - Gemini CLI (the tool that loads an extension in place): rendered into
#     build/extensions/<name>/ as a COMPLETE installable tree — the verbatim
#     source tree plus the rendered gemini-extension.json and commands/*.toml
#     — because that tree is what install-extension.sh installs or links
#     (spec 0173Δ R20/R22).
#   - Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Antigravity CLI (tools that build a
#     plugin): delegated unchanged to their existing per-CLI builders
#     (scripts/build-{claude,copilot,antigravity}-*.sh), which keep their own
#     ephemeral output roots (dist-claude-plugin/, dist-copilot-plugin/,
#     dist-antigravity-plugin/) — spec 0173 R6/R7.
#
# `--check` (0173Δ R10, as amended by spec 0183 R9/R11) runs over TWO
# subjects. For every discovered EXTENSION:
#   (a) COMMITTED  — no file of the generated-output class
#       (scripts/lib/extension-generated-class.json) is committed anywhere in
#       the extension's SOURCE tree, AND no file committed anywhere in that
#       tree is named for a supported command-line tool
#       (ext_name_axis_scan, spec 0183 R9) with no declaration generating it
#       — whether or not that file is also a generated-output-class member.
#   (b) RENDER-FAIL — a fresh --target all render succeeds.
#   (c) MISSING/UNDECLARED — the Gemini build tree's generated-class members
#       equal exactly the declared output set (the in-place target only —
#       the one target whose output set is enumerable independently of the
#       declarations; the plugin targets' file sets are pinned by
#       scripts/tests/test-extension-render-conformance.sh instead).
#   (d) GAP-UNDECLARED/GAP-STALE — the render's observed gap set
#       (build/gaps/<name>/observed-gaps.json) against the hand-authored,
#       committed extensions/<tier>/<name>/accepted-gaps.json (absent means
#       the empty set — 0173Δ R13).
#   (e) VERSION-DRIFT — the built gemini-extension.json's .version equals the
#       extension's authoritative version declaration (0173Δ R11, 0044Δ R9).
# For the SCAFFOLD TEMPLATE CONTAINER (extension-skeleton/, spec 0183 R9's
# Scenario "The scaffold template container is charged like an extension
# tree"), checked once per run regardless of any extension argument:
#   (a) COMMITTED (name-axis only) — no committed file under
#       extension-skeleton/ is named for a supported command-line tool. Arms
#       (b)-(e) do not apply: the container has no declarations to render, no
#       version, and no gap set.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/build-extension.sh [--target {gemini,claude,copilot,antigravity,all}] [<extension-dir-or-name> ...]
#   bash scripts/build-extension.sh --check [<extension-dir-or-name> ...]
#
#   With no extension argument, every extension under
#   extensions/{core,library,org} that carries an extension.json at its root
#   is processed (scripts/lib/extension-manifest.sh ext_discover_dirs).
#
# Prerequisites: jq, yq.

# build/extensions/<name> tree). build-claude-plugin.sh's own

# extensions/core and extensions/library, and
# scripts/tests/test-install-claude-plugin-marketplace.sh's `find` over the
