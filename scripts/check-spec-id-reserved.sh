# check-spec-id-reserved.sh — Fail a pull request whose new spec claims an id
# that was never secured, or was secured for a different ticket (spec 0112
# requirement 7, as replaced by delta-01).
#
# This is the BACKSTOP, not the mechanism. scripts/reserve-spec-id.sh secures an
# id at pickup time; this guard is what makes an unsecured id a pull-request
# failure instead of a surprise discovered by an unrelated third PR after both
# offending specs have merged.
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED. Every non-delta spec file the change ADDS or RENAMES, outside
# `specs/org/`. Delta-specs are exempt (requirement 11): a delta reuses its
# parent's id by construction and secures nothing. Specs under `specs/org/` are
# exempt (delta-01, replaced requirement 7), consistent with the exclusion
# `specs/0071-org-specs-lint-exclusion.md` establishes for upstream validation of
# org-owned content. `specs/org/` is an unconditional floor; the `excluded`
# entries under `specs/` in `.crewrig/core-paths.txt` are read ON TOP of it, so a
# future org-owned path is covered without editing this script while an absent
# manifest cannot silently turn the exemption off.
#
# WHERE THE RECORD IS READ. Both upstream carriers, on the remote:
# `refs/spec-ids/*` and `refs/tags/spec-id/*`. Always both, never the configured
# one alone — a repository mid-transition between carriers must not be reported
# as unsecured for the ids it holds in the other. The org sibling namespaces
# (`refs/spec-ids-org/*`, `refs/tags/spec-id-org/*`) are never read here: an
# upstream `0042` and an org `0042` are a conformant state, not a collision
# (delta-01, scenario 5).
#
# THE MARK MUST AGREE WITH THE RESERVATION. `docs/spec-format.md` states that a
# merged spec never carries `unsecured-id`, and this script is the only place
# that holds both the frontmatter mark and the remote's reservation state at
# once — so it is the only place that invariant can be enforced. An id secured
# for its own ticket while the spec still declares `unsecured-id: true` is a
# finding: the field exists to be machine-readable, so a stale `true` misinforms
# every consumer, in the direction that looks permissive.
#
# THE TWO-RECORDS RULE. One UPSTREAM id recorded in BOTH upstream carriers
# naming two different issues is a collision, failed loudly naming both tickets.
# This guard does not pick a winner: that state is the exact duplicate-holder
# outcome spec 0112 exists to prevent, and arbitrating it silently would hide it.
#
# TWO DISTINCT DEGRADATIONS, deliberately not symmetric:
#   - The reserved set is UNREADABLE (a credential gap on a private adopter
#     repository, an unreachable remote) → REPORT without failing. A credential
#     gap must never block an adopter's pipeline, and an unreadable namespace is
#     measurably indistinguishable from an empty one, so failing here would
#     accuse every id of being unsecured.
#   - The pull request's ORIGIN cannot be determined → FAIL LOUDLY, exit 2. That
#     is a wiring defect, and reporting-without-failing would green-light the
#     same-repository case this guard exists for.
#
# ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION (requirement 10). A pull request from a branch of the
# reference repository FAILS on an unsecured id; one from a FORK reports without
# blocking, because its author cannot write to the reference repository. A
# maintainer secures the id before merging and removes the requirement-9 mark in
# the same act. Origin comes from an explicit signal, never an inference:
#
#   CREWRIG_SPEC_ID_ORIGIN
#       'same' or 'fork' — the explicit override, for a local run.
#   CREWRIG_PR_HEAD_REPO / CREWRIG_PR_BASE_REPO
#       GitHub Actions: mapped from
#       `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name` and
#       `github.repository` by an `env:` block in .github/workflows/build.yml,
#       because those are workflow CONTEXTS, not ambient environment. The
#       `CREWRIG_` prefix is this repository's own convention (CREWRIG_REPO_DIR,
#       CREWRIG_GITLAB_HOSTS) and it also avoids `GITHUB_`, which GitHub Actions
#       reserves — a `GITHUB_`-prefixed name would look native while being a
#       value GitHub does not in fact publish, and would collide with the
#       reserved prefix in the very `env:` block that has to set it.
#   CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_PROJECT_PATH / CI_PROJECT_PATH
#       GitLab CI: already ambient in a merge-request pipeline.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-spec-id-reserved.sh [<base-ref>]
#
# Environment:
#   BASE_REF           The change's target branch. Default: the first remote
#                      matching `crewrig|origin`, plus `/main`.
#   CREWRIG_REPO_DIR   Repository root override (used by the self-test).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every checked id is secured for its own ticket; or the pull request comes
#      from a fork and the conditions were reported; or the reserved set could
#      not be read and was reported.
#   1  at least one blocking finding on a same-repository pull request.
#   2  wiring fault — origin undeterminable, base ref unresolvable, or not a
#      git repository. Fail closed: a run that could not look must not read as a
#      run that found nothing.

#
# The GitHub arm never carried the bug: build.yml maps

# resolves its own target. The generated GitLab job sets only GIT_DEPTH and passes
# no argument, while its own rule fires on

# merge request fell through to `<remote>/main` and diffed against the wrong
# branch. Every spec that had landed on the release branch since it forked from
# main then read as "added by this change", and the check BLOCKED a conformant
