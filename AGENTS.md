# CrewRig — Agent Working Rules

The rules and conventions all agents (human or AI) must follow when contributing to this project.

## What is CrewRig?

CrewRig is a centralized configuration framework for Gemini CLI, Claude Code,
GitHub Copilot CLI, and Antigravity CLI. Any agent loading this file should
understand these five pillars without needing to read README.md or ADRs:

1. **Layered context system engineering** — 00–60 priority files deployed to
   CLI user directories (`~/.gemini/`, `~/.claude/rules/`,
   `~/.copilot/instructions/`, `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`) that shape how AI
   assistants behave for a specific user's role, team, and seniority.
2. **Shared cross-tool memory** — MemPalace provides persistent agent memory
   accessible across tools and sessions, enabling continuity between Gemini
   CLI, Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and Antigravity CLI.
3. **Skill/agent/command creation and sharing** — `artifacts/` is the
   single-source zone where skills, agents, and commands are authored once;
   `scripts/build-components.sh` compiles them into outputs for all four CLIs.
4. **Harness engineering** — a built-in feedback loop where agents invoke the
   `harness-report` skill to tag frictions during real work, and the
   `harness-curator` skill clusters those frictions into actionable GitHub
   issues.
5. **Multi-CLI parity** — features are implemented symmetrically across Claude
   Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Antigravity CLI. Silent asymmetry
   is prohibited; every parity gap requires concrete evidence that the missing
   mechanism does not exist in the target CLI.

## Session Bootstrap

**Before any work begins**, the agent SHALL run the complete deterministic
session-start sweep defined in
`artifacts/core/rules/60-tools.md` → *Memory Activation Protocol → Session Start*
(all six steps, in order). The project-specific parameter for step 3 is
`wing="crewrig"`, `room="task-handoff"`.

Skipping the sweep is a process violation equivalent to missing a lifecycle
stage. A REVIEW pass that audits a session where the sweep was omitted SHALL
emit a `class: tech` finding citing this section.

**Reviewer-seat exemption.** A seated pass — an agent instantiated per
[`docs/reviewer-seat.md`](docs/reviewer-seat.md) → *Instantiating a seated
pass*, occupying the `specs`, `plan`, or `review` surface, on any pass
ordinal of that seat — skips step 3 (cross-tool handoff lookup) and step 6
(mandatory checkpoint write) of the sweep above, and still runs steps 1, 2,
4, and 5 unchanged. The preceding paragraph's "process violation" rule and
its accompanying `class: tech` finding do NOT apply to a seated pass's
correctly-reasoned skip of steps 3 and 6 — see
[`docs/reviewer-seat.md`](docs/reviewer-seat.md) → *Session Bootstrap for a
seated pass* for the full rationale. Every other role — the orchestrator, a
`developer` pass, an `architect` pass acting outside a seated review,
`pr-logbook`, etc. — remains fully bound by the unmodified six-step sweep,
with no exemption.

Additionally, before opening any new ticket worktree, perform the additive,
non-destructive session-start worktree-backlog surfacing in
[`docs/agent-team-protocol.md`](docs/agent-team-protocol.md) → *Worktree
Isolation* → *Session-boundary worktree hygiene* — it reports already-merged
worktrees but removes nothing.

## Lifecycle

Every non-trivial ticket SHALL flow through the four-stage lifecycle
**SPECS → PLAN → DEV → REVIEW**. REVIEW loops back into the upstream
stage corresponding to the class of each finding (`tech` → DEV,
`arch` → PLAN, `spec` → SPECS). The lifecycle terminates only when a
full REVIEW pass produces zero findings.

```

The full contract — stage definitions, transition rules, finding
taxonomy, routing matrix, complexity tiers, and termination criterion
— lives in [ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md).
The file format for the spec artifact produced by the SPECS stage —
frontmatter schema, mandatory body sections, delta-spec convention,
and naming rules — lives in [`docs/spec-format.md`](docs/spec-format.md).

## Language

All **project content must be written in English**. "Project content" covers
every artifact that lands in the repository or on GitHub — there are no
exceptions for "internal" notes, draft documents, or AI-authored prose.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- **File content in the repository** — source code, inline comments,
  documentation prose, READMEs, ADRs, RFCs, configuration files, shell
  scripts, and every framework artifact (`SKILL.md`, `AGENT.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.).
- **GitHub artifacts** — commit messages, PR titles, PR bodies, PR review
  comments, issue titles, issue bodies, and every comment posted on an
  issue or PR (including incremental logbook updates).

**Decision rule:** *Is this landing in the project or on GitHub?* → English
only.

**Exception:** Interpersonal interactions between the user and the agent
(chat sessions, transient terminal output) MUST be conducted in the **User
Preferred Language**. This exception covers only ephemeral dialogue — the
moment content is committed, pushed, or posted to GitHub, the English-only
rule takes over.

## Branching Strategy

- The primary branch is `main`, linked to the `origin` remote (GitHub).
- The `main` branch is **protected**: no direct pushes allowed.
- Every change must go through a **feature branch** merged into `main` via a Pull Request.
- **NEVER merge a Pull Request (PR/MR)** without asking for the user's formal permission JUST BEFORE executing the merge.
  - Narrow one-file spec-PR exception: [`docs/interaction-modes.md`](docs/interaction-modes.md) → *User-gate definition*.
- The `import/gitlab` branch tracks the legacy GitLab project (`gitlab` remote) and serves as inspiration only.
- **Up-to-date merge precondition:** BEFORE executing `gh pr merge`, the agent MUST verify that the branch is up-to-date with `main` (`git fetch crewrig main`, `git rebase crewrig/main` or `gh pr update-branch`). If `main` has advanced since the branch was created/rebased, the agent MUST update the branch and re-verify all test suites pass on the rebased state prior to merging.
- Non-trivial tickets follow the **Spec-PR workflow** (see below).

### On Claude Code CLI — solo-maintainer self-merge block

Claude-Code-only guidance; agents on other CLIs may skip it. See
[`docs/solo-merge-classifier-workaround.md`](docs/solo-merge-classifier-workaround.md)
for the full detail.

**Critical rule:** a `gh pr merge` denied by the Claude Code auto-mode
classifier on the author's own PR SHALL be re-attempted once by the same agent,
then handed to the user if still denied — NEVER delegated to a sibling
(delegating launders a refused permission).

## Pre-Edit Guard

Before writing or editing **any** file in the repository, the agent MUST
confirm that all three of the following conditions hold:

1. **A GitHub issue exists** for the work — pre-existing or freshly created
   in this session.
2. **A feature branch is active** — the current working context is NOT
   `main` (or `master`). The branch name MUST follow the
   `<prefix>/<NNNN>-<slug>` convention defined in *Branching Strategy* above.
3. **A dedicated worktree is in use** — the working directory is
   `.worktrees/<ticket-id>/`, NOT the repository root.

**Process violation.** Editing any file without satisfying all three
conditions is a process violation. A REVIEW pass that audits a session
where the guard was bypassed SHALL emit a `class: tech` finding citing
this section.

**Exemption.** Trivial single-file edits explicitly scoped by the user in
the same conversational turn are exempt from condition 3 (worktree), but
NOT from conditions 1 (issue) and 2 (feature branch). There is no
edit-without-branch exemption.

## Spec-PR workflow

This section operationalises the SPECS stage of the lifecycle defined in
[ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) — specifically
the *Stage definitions → SPECS* contract — and the two-PR convention
mandated by [`specs/0003-spec-pr-workflow.md`](specs/0003-spec-pr-workflow.md).
The SPECS-stage artifact (a single Markdown file under `/specs/`) MUST
ship as its own pull request — the **spec-PR** — and be merged to `main`
**before** any implementation branch for the same ticket is opened.

See [`docs/spec-pr-workflow.md`](docs/spec-pr-workflow.md) for the
rationale and the full rule set: the one-file rule, the ordering rule,
the independence rule, the delta-spec cumulative rule, and the worktree
pointer.

### Branch naming

- Initial spec-branch: `spec/<NNNN>-<slug>` — where `<NNNN>` is the
  zero-padded spec id and `<slug>` is the kebab-case slug. Both values
  MUST match the spec file's frontmatter `id` and `slug` fields; the
  schema is defined in [`docs/spec-format.md`](docs/spec-format.md).
- Delta-spec branch (produced by a `spec`-class iteration of the
  *Retroactive review loop*): `spec/<NNNN>-<slug>-delta-<NN>` — where
  `<NN>` is the zero-padded delta sequence number for that spec id.

## Post-Merge Flow

After any `gh pr merge`, the agent MUST verify the merge target before closing the task.

See [`docs/post-merge-flow.md`](docs/post-merge-flow.md) for the
target-branch check, the downstream-PR criteria, and the open-or-propose
step.

This rule applies regardless of whether the merge was initiated by a human or an agent — the obligation to verify downstream propagation is the same.

## Naming Convention

The [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention applies to **all named project artifacts** — not only git commit messages:

- **Git commits** — `<emoji> <Short description>`
- **Issue titles** — `<emoji> <Short description>`
- **Pull request titles** — `<emoji> <Short description>`

Never use conventional-commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) in any of the above. Gitmoji is the sole convention.

Examples:

- `🎉 Initial commit`
- `✨ Add user authentication module`
- `🐛 Fix null pointer in config loader`
- `📝 Update README with setup instructions`
- `♻️ Refactor settings parser for clarity`

## Version Bump Convention

Skill and agent sources carry a `metadata.provenance.version` field that
tracks shipped revisions. One rule and one exemption govern when it must change.

**Rule — bump on modification of shipped sources.** Any diff that modifies
a skill or agent source already present on `main` MUST bump
`metadata.provenance.version` in the same diff.

See [`docs/version-bump-convention.md`](docs/version-bump-convention.md)
for the full list of affected paths, the extension provenance-carrier
detail, and the new-component in-branch exemption.

**SemVer guidance for bumps:**

- `PATCH` (1.0.x) — friction fix, wording change
- `MINOR` (1.x.0) — additive change (new section, new field)
- `MAJOR` (x.0.0) — breaking contract change

**Enforcement.** `scripts/check-skill-versions.sh` runs in CI, diffs the
PR against its target branch, and fails the build when a modified source
ships without a version bump.

## CLI Matrix Maintenance

See [`docs/cli-matrix-maintenance.md`](docs/cli-matrix-maintenance.md) for the full protocol governing CLI-specific integration points, parity checks, gap-acceptance evidence, and the symmetric-script rule.

**Summary:** Any PR touching `.claude/**`, `.gemini/**`, `artifacts/**`, `extensions/**`,
`hooks/*-transcript-hooks.json`, `config/claude/**`, `config/gemini/**`,
`scripts/build-components.sh`, any `scripts/{build,install,setup,import,manage}-*.sh`,
`.github/workflows/claude.yml` or `.github/workflows/gemini.yml`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or CLI-prefixed `Taskfile.yml` entries MUST consult and update
`docs/cli-matrix.md` in the same diff.

**Core-paths manifest co-maintenance.** Any PR that adds, removes, or reclassifies a
core-layer path in `docs/layers.md` MUST update `.crewrig/core-paths.txt` in the same diff.
This manifest is the machine-readable source of truth consumed by `scripts/sync-from-upstream.sh`.

## Agent Team Protocol

See [`docs/agent-team-protocol.md`](docs/agent-team-protocol.md) for the full protocol: team templates, worktree isolation, team communication rules, team shutdown, and team sizing by complexity.

**Critical rules — apply without reading the full doc:**

- **Solo work prohibition.** Never treat a multi-step ticket with inline solo work when specialist agents are available. Inline solo work is reserved for trivial single-file edits explicitly scoped by the user.
- **Coordination primitives on Claude Code CLI.** Claude Code runs a single implicit session team — there is no team to create. Use `Agent` (always with an explicit `subagent_type`) to delegate work to a specialist, and `SendMessage` for all cross-agent communication — these two primitives are confirmed present on Claude Code and mandatory, not optional. `TaskCreate` (one task per role; self-contained brief in the `Agent` prompt) tracks that delegation when the harness exposes it; it is confirmed absent from the current Claude Code harness's tool surface (`docs/cli-matrix.md` → *Parity gaps*, issue #1267), and that absence is not a protocol violation to work around — proceed with `Agent` and `SendMessage` alone.
- **Worktree isolation.** Before the `Agent` spawn that opens the ticket — and before any `TaskCreate` call too, when the harness exposes it — create a dedicated git worktree. All team edits happen inside `.worktrees/<ticket-id>/`. The main working directory is read-only for the duration.
- **Anti-permission-laundering.** Never re-execute a subagent's denied action in the parent session. Subagent permission denials are treated as user-authored rejections and MUST be surfaced to the user for decision.
- **Whole-tree git ops.** `git reset --hard`, `git stash`, `git clean` require an exclusive claim + empty `git status`. See [`docs/agent-team-protocol.md`](docs/agent-team-protocol.md) → *Worktree Isolation*.
- **Built components.** Any commit touching `artifacts/` MUST also run `bash scripts/build-components.sh` and stage the regenerated outputs in the same commit.
- **Complexity tier.** Read the spec frontmatter `complexity` field at ticket pickup: `trivial` = inline, `small` = developer + pr-logbook + pr-reviewer, `standard` = full Template 1/2/3, `large` = architect-led sub-spec decomposition.
- **Idle notification non-completion.** `idle_notification` events indicate thread status at event emission time and are NOT request completion signals; never abandon subagents on an idle event while a request is pending.

```sh
git worktree add -b <branch-name> .worktrees/<ticket-id> crewrig/main
```

## Interaction modes

The lifecycle (per [ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md))
runs in one of four modes (FULL, INTERMEDIATE, MINIMAL, AUTO). Mode controls
*user gating*, not stage execution — every mode runs all four stages.

See [`docs/interaction-modes.md`](docs/interaction-modes.md) for the
`User-gate definition` and the full `Behavioral contract per (mode ×
stage) cell` table.

## Plan review protocol

The PLAN stage of the lifecycle (per
[ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) →
*Stage definitions → PLAN*) emits exactly one artifact: a Markdown
comment posted on the logbook issue. The protocol below operationalises
who authors that comment, who reviews it, what shape the review takes,
and how revisions chain. The format of the plan comment itself —
header conventions, mandatory sections, optional sections, finding tag
schema — lives in [`docs/plan-format.md`](docs/plan-format.md) and is
mandated by [`specs/0004-plan-format-and-review.md`](specs/0004-plan-format-and-review.md).
This section SHALL NOT duplicate that schema; consult the format
document for any field-level question.

See [`docs/plan-review-protocol.md`](docs/plan-review-protocol.md) for
the authoring rule, the cold second-`architect` review rule, reviewer-minted IDs (`v<N>-F<M>`), prior-finding audits, the
finding-class taxonomy (`tech` / `arch` / `spec`), the
REQUEST-CHANGES-blocks-DEV rule, and the per-tier PLAN-loop cap.

## Retroactive review loop

This section operationalises the REVIEW stage of the lifecycle (per
[ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) →
*Stage definitions → REVIEW*) and the routing contract mandated by
[`specs/0005-retroactive-routing-engine.md`](specs/0005-retroactive-routing-engine.md).

See [`docs/retroactive-loop.md`](docs/retroactive-loop.md) for the
finding-class loop targets (`tech`/`arch`/`spec`), the termination check,
the 5-iteration guardrail, the mode-conditional handling of non-blocking
findings, and the rule against changing the logbook issue mid-loop.

## Reviewer seat

Every review pass is attributed to exactly one **reviewer seat**, keyed
`<surface>/<ticket>` on one of three surfaces (`specs`, `plan`, `review`), and
every verdict a seat posts carries a `seat: <surface>/<ticket>[#<generation>]`
line. A seat is not a surviving process: each pass is a fresh agent holding no
authoring context that reconstructs its dossier — its own prior verdicts — from
the forge, and from its second pass onward is bound to the change since the
revision it last examined plus the surfaces that change reaches.

See [`docs/reviewer-seat.md`](docs/reviewer-seat.md) for the full contract: the
dossier, the references-only brief, the prior-finding disposition record, the
per-surface finding identifiers, and the vacancy and retirement paths.

## Pull Request Format

See [`docs/pr-format.md`](docs/pr-format.md) for the required PR structure:
the title convention and the full PR-body template (purpose sentences, *How
to read this PR?*, *How to test this PR?*, and *Detailed description (for
agents)*).

## Logbook Issues

Every PR **must** be anchored to a **logbook** on GitHub — a journal that
traces every obstacle encountered (with its resolution or avoidance
strategy), every challenge faced, and every success or breakthrough, so the
full experience of agents on the project is recorded for future reference.

See [`docs/logbook-issues.md`](docs/logbook-issues.md) for the three
rules governing logbooks: Rule A (a feature issue IS its own logbook),
Rule B (update incrementally, not at the end), and Rule C (close immediately
after merge).

## Forge Access

Forge access is CLI-only. Forge operations (issues, PRs/MRs, branch protection, releases) route through the forge's own CLI — `gh` (GitHub), `glab` (GitLab), `tea` (Gitea) — with authentication delegated to that CLI; the framework ships no forge MCP server. Native `git` remains the tool for ordinary version control and is unchanged. See `artifacts/core/rules/60-tools.md` → *Forge Access* for the per-CLI `auth login` details. Re-add a forge MCP via [org MCP declaration](docs/org-mcp-declaration.md).

## Legacy ticket policy

Tickets opened **before** the merge of PR #176 (which introduced
[ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) and the
SPECS → PLAN → DEV → REVIEW lifecycle, on `main` on **2026-05-31**)
were eligible for one-time migration triage under
[`specs/0008-migration-of-in-flight-tickets.md`](specs/0008-migration-of-in-flight-tickets.md).
Tickets opened on or after that date SHALL follow the new lifecycle
by default.

See [`docs/legacy-ticket-policy.md`](docs/legacy-ticket-policy.md) for
the full cutoff rule, the legacy contract that `keep-legacy` tickets
run under, and the audit-table reference.

## Organization rules extension

The adopting organization extends these rules through the org-owned
`AGENTS.org.md`, never by editing this upstream-owned file (spec 0020).
Claude Code resolves the import below natively and recursively. Gemini CLI
and GitHub Copilot CLI do not resolve `@file` includes in this surface, so
their setup scripts deploy `AGENTS.org.md` as a priority-66 rules file
(`~/.gemini/66_ORG_RULES.md` and
`~/.copilot/instructions/66-org-rules.instructions.md` respectively) — see
[`docs/cli-matrix.md`](docs/cli-matrix.md) row 7e.

<!-- Claude-native recursive import; per-CLI fallback handled at setup time. -->
@AGENTS.org.md
