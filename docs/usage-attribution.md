# Usage attribution

<!-- crewrig-doc: section=reference nav_order=135 published=true title="Usage attribution" -->

The usage attribution contract (spec 0208) resolves every usage record to the macro-task it served — either a CrewRig task-handoff key from the session-start protocol or another ticketing system, or an external work-tracking asset such as a forge issue — and provides an append-only ledger to correct or override that attribution after the fact without touching the record itself. A record's attribution resolves once, at capture time, from exactly one of four ordered declaration channels, and no later mutation of the record ever changes what resolution produced.

This page is one stage of the usage feature; the [usage architecture overview](usage-overview.md) shows how the stages fit together.

## What attribution is

**Attribution** answers the question "what task was this usage record serving?" A record carries no task information at capture time; attribution is resolved later, when the record is handed to storage, by evaluating four possible sources in fixed order:

1. **Explicit human declaration** — the operator has declared a task explicitly via the `usage-task.sh` command.
2. **Environment variable** — the `CREWRIG_TASK` environment variable names a task.
3. **Worktree or branch derivation** — the current directory's own worktree path (`.worktrees/<NNNN>`) or checked-out branch name matches a CrewRig ticket-branch convention.
4. **Session-start protocol** — the framework's own session-start protocol has established or resumed a task-handoff drawer for this session and recorded its key.

A record for which **none** of the four channels produces a valid value carries no attribution, recorded as `unattributed` together with the name of the first present channel and its validation failure.

**Resolution** evaluates the four channels in the fixed order above and stops at the first channel that is present — one that supplies a candidate value at all. A lower-ranked channel is never consulted, even if the first present channel's value fails validation.

## Declaration channels

### Channel 1: Explicit human declaration

The operator declares a task-handoff key and/or an external asset reference explicitly:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --task-key 1171
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --asset forge-issue:crewrig/crewrig#1171
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --task-key 1171 --asset forge-issue:crewrig/crewrig#1171
```

A later explicit declaration replaces the earlier one in full (R2 — "full replacement, never merge"). This channel carries the highest priority.

### Channel 2: Environment variable

The `CREWRIG_TASK` environment variable, when set, declares a task-handoff key and/or an external asset reference:

```bash
export CREWRIG_TASK=1171
export CREWRIG_TASK='forge-issue:crewrig/crewrig#1171'
export CREWRIG_TASK='1171:forge-issue:github.com/owner/repo#number'  # both key and asset
```

The operator exports the variable in the shell that launches the CLI session (or sets it in the CLI's own environment configuration); the running session's own hooks read it when a usage record is captured — there is no script to invoke directly.

The syntax is `<key>`, `<kind>:<ref>`, or `<key>:<kind>:<ref>` (colon-delimited). This channel is present when the variable is set and non-empty.

### Channel 3: Worktree or branch derivation

When the session runs inside a CrewRig worktree (`.worktrees/<NNNN>/` directory) or on a ticket-branch (branches matching `<prefix>/<NNNN>-<slug>`), the ticket identifier is derived entirely offline from filesystem data — the `.git/` directory structure, the `HEAD` file, and the git config — without any subprocess call:

1. **Worktree path** — the segment `.worktrees/866/` yields ticket `866`.
2. **Spec-file resolution** (for spec-branch `spec/<NNNN>-<slug>` or `spec/<NNNN>-<slug>-delta-<NN>`) — the spec file `specs/<NNNN>-<slug>.md` or `specs/<NNNN>-<slug>.delta-<NN>.md` is read; if present and carries a `related-issue: <NNNN>` field, that ticket number becomes the task-handoff key.
3. **Ticket-branch grammar** (for branches matching `<prefix>/<NNNN>-<slug>` where the prefix is not `spec/`) — the ticket number `<NNNN>` is extracted directly.

When a ticket identifier is resolved, the channel additionally derives a `forge-issue` external asset reference (if a recognized forge is reachable):

- The checked-out branch's own configured upstream remote is consulted first; if none exists, the remote named `origin` is used (R8).
- The remote's URL is parsed entirely offline (no network call) to extract the host and owner/repository pair.
- If the host is `github.com` or `gitlab.com` (or a custom host named via `CREWRIG_FORGE_HOSTS`), a `forge-issue` asset is populated as `<owner>/<repo>#<ticket>`.
- If no qualifying remote is found or the remote URL's host is not recognized, the ticket-handoff key alone is returned, together with a stated reason explaining which rule step found no qualifying remote.

Examples:

- `.worktrees/1171/` on a branch with `origin` pointing at `git@github.com:crewrig/crewrig.git` → `taskHandoffKey: "1171"`, `externalAsset: {kind: "forge-issue", ref: "crewrig/crewrig#1171"}`.
- `spec/0208-usage-attribution` on a branch with upstream `hcross` (a fork pointing at `git@github.com:hcross/crewrig.git`) → `taskHandoffKey: "1171"` (from `related-issue`), `externalAsset: {kind: "forge-issue", ref: "hcross/crewrig#1171"}` (from the fork's own upstream).
- The fork-remote residue (R8's documented limitation): a fork clone derives a different `forge-issue` asset ref than a canonical clone for the same task-handoff key — the key itself is unaffected. This is the one case a task key is textually identical across CLIs but its external asset is not. **Recourse:** declare the task explicitly via `--channel explicit` to bypass this derivation and assert the asset you intend.

### Channel 4: Session-start protocol

When the framework's own session-start protocol establishes or resumes a task-handoff drawer, it records the drawer's own task-handoff key with `declaringChannel: "protocol"`. This channel is present only when the session-start protocol has run; a session that never enters the protocol (for instance, a historical backfill or a capture outside the framework) leaves this channel without a candidate value.

This channel carries the lowest priority and is consulted only when channels 1, 2 and 3 are all absent.

## The declaration record

A session's declaration record is a JSON file that holds:

```json
{
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "declaringChannel": "explicit",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T10:00:00Z"
}
```

or:

```json
{
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "externalAsset": {"kind": "forge-issue", "ref": "crewrig/crewrig#1171"},
  "declaringChannel": "protocol",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Writing the declaration record

The `bash scripts/usage-task.sh set` command writes a declaration record:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --task-key 1171 [--session <sessionId>]
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel protocol --task-key 1171 [--session <sessionId>]
```

Optionally, an external asset reference may be included:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --asset forge-issue:crewrig/crewrig#1171
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --task-key 1171 --asset jira-key:ORC-42
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --asset shared-file:/path/to/doc.md
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --asset shared-file:https://example.com/shared-doc
```

A later write replaces the record in full (R2). The `declaringChannel` field distinguishes human-authored declarations (`explicit`) from framework-authored declarations (`protocol`), each with its own semantics (R3).

### Scopes

The declaration record is scoped in one of two ways:

- **Session scope** — when `CREWRIG_SESSION_ID` is set or `--session <id>` is passed, the record is session-specific and lives under `<root>/declarations/session/`.
- **Project scope** — otherwise, the record is project-specific, keyed on the current working directory's checkout root (or its nearest ancestor holding `.git/`, or a hash of the directory path as a fallback), and lives under `<root>/declarations/project/`.

When reading, both scopes are consulted, and the scope with the later timestamp wins (latest-timestamp-wins rule, R2). A project-scope declaration older than `CREWRIG_TASK_DECLARATION_TTL_MS` (default 12 hours) is discarded as stale.

### The `usage-task` command surface

```bash
task usage:task             # Alias for the command below
bash scripts/usage-task.sh set --channel explicit --task-key 1171
bash scripts/usage-task.sh show [--session <sessionId>]
bash scripts/usage-task.sh clear [--session <sessionId>]
```

This command is **repository-level** and **identical on all four CLIs** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Antigravity); no per-CLI wiring is needed.

## Offline forge derivation

The worktree-or-branch channel (channel 3) derives a `forge-issue` external asset entirely offline using the fixed rule sequence in R8. The resolved remote's URL is parsed to extract the host and `owner/repo` pair. This derivation never performs a network call and never validates that the referenced issue exists.

## The attribution sidecar

Each journal entry is accompanied by a `.attr.json` sidecar carrying the channel that resolved the record's attribution and, if the channel produced an invalid candidate, the validation failure:

```json
{
  "channel": "explicit",
  "outcome": "attributed",
  "reason": null,
  "assetReason": null
}
```

or:

```json
{
  "channel": "env",
  "outcome": "unattributed",
  "reason": "invalid taskHandoffKey: \"...\"",
  "assetReason": null
}
```

The sidecar is immutable after the entry is written and is never re-derived by a later operation. It is stored alongside the entry in the same partition directory:

```text
<root>/journal/<cli>/<YYYY-MM>/<recordId>.json
<root>/journal/<cli>/<YYYY-MM>/<recordId>.attr.json
```

Inspecting a record's attribution sidecar without needing to re-derive it:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-attribute.sh explain --record <recordId> --cli <cli> --period <YYYY-MM>
```

## The attribution ledger

The ledger is an append-only store of retroactive attribution assignments, distinct from the journal. Entries are immutable once written and are keyed by the period of their own `timestamp`:

```text
<root>/ledger/<YYYY-MM>/<entryId>.json
```

An entry names exactly one scope (session, agent+parent, or period) and assigns a task-handoff key and/or an external asset reference to every record belonging to that scope.

### Ledger entry shape

```json
{
  "scope": {"session": "…"},
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T10:00:00Z",
  "author": "hcross",
  "reason": "spec-authoring session for #1171"
}
```

All five fields are required. The `author` field records who made the entry; the `reason` field explains why the entry was created.

### Writing a ledger entry

```bash
task usage:attribute add --session <sessionId> --task-key 1171 --reason "session-start protocol established drawer 1171" [--author <name>]
task usage:attribute add --agent <agentId> --parent <parentSessionId> --asset forge-issue:crewrig/crewrig#1171 --reason "agent ran as part of task 1171"
task usage:attribute add --period 2026-09 --task-key 1171 --reason "retroactive: all activity in September was task 1171" [--author <name>]
```

When invoked via `task`, the `--author` defaults to the git user's configured name. When invoked directly via `bash scripts/usage-attribute.sh`, all required fields must be provided.

An identical entry (same scope, key, asset, timestamp, author, and reason) appended twice is a no-op — the ledger uses content-addressed entry IDs, so re-appending is idempotent (R13).

### Reading the ledger

```bash
task usage:attribute list [--session <sessionId> | --agent <agentId> --parent <parentSessionId> | --period <YYYY-MM>]
```

Lists all ledger entries matching the given filters. When no filter is given, all entries are listed.

## Read surface and ledger application

When a record is read from the journal (via `bash scripts/usage-query.sh`), the ledger is consulted:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-query.sh --task-key 1171
bash scripts/usage-query.sh --session <sessionId> --rollup
```

**Ledger application** (R15): If a ledger entry names the session, agent, or period a record belongs to, that entry's task-handoff key and/or external asset reference **replaces** the record's own attribution at read time. The record itself is not modified; only the returned result carries the overridden attribution.

The underlying record and its sidecar remain unchanged — a ledger entry never mutates the journal (R16).

### Bypassing the ledger

To read records with their original attribution, bypassing any ledger overrides:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-query.sh --task-key 1171 --no-ledger
```

This returns the entry verbatim, as it was written.

## Rollups

A rollup aggregates records by task-handoff key or external asset reference, reporting token counts grouped by **fidelity** — the granularity at which a record was captured (per-request, run-total, or session-cumulative):

```bash
bash scripts/usage-query.sh --task-key 1171 --rollup
bash scripts/usage-query.sh --asset forge-issue:crewrig/crewrig#1171 --rollup
bash scripts/usage-query.sh --task-key 1171 --rollup --combined
bash scripts/usage-query.sh --period 2026-09 --task-key 1171 --rollup
```

Selectors compose, so the last line rolls up only task 1171's records. With `--period`, a `session-cumulative` session counts through its last snapshot in the selection, and only in the month holding that snapshot (see [Period rollups](usage-pricing.md#period-rollups)).

### Rollup output shape

```json
{
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "byFidelity": {
    "per-request": {"netInput": 12000, "cacheRead": 3000, "cacheWrite": 500, "output": 4000, "reasoning": 800},
    "run-total": {"netInput": 5000, "cacheRead": 1000, "cacheWrite": 200, "output": 2000, "reasoning": 0},
    "session-cumulative": {"netInput": 9000, "cacheRead": 0, "cacheWrite": 0, "output": 2500, "reasoning": 0}
  },
  "uncapturedCount": 1
}
```

Each fidelity's counts are summed independently. For `session-cumulative` records, **only the last snapshot per session** is included in the sum (R20, R22) — never a sum across multiple snapshots of the same session.

### Combined totals

When `--combined` is passed, a `combined` field is added carrying a sum across fidelities:

```json
{
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "byFidelity": {...},
  "combined": {"netInput": 26000, "cacheRead": 4000, "cacheWrite": 700, "output": 8500, "reasoning": 800, "mixed": ["per-request", "run-total", "session-cumulative"]},
  "uncapturedCount": 1
}
```

The `mixed` field lists every fidelity that contributed to the combined sum. A combined total is never presented without this `mixed` marker (R21).

### Uncaptured records

The `uncapturedCount` field reports how many records attributed to the task or asset were never captured — for example, incomplete requests, crashed processes, or offline captures. This count is reported separately from every token-count sum and is never folded into or represented as a placeholder value within any sum (R24).

A task or asset with zero `uncaptured` records reports that count as zero, never omits it.

## Session-start protocol recording

When the framework's own session-start protocol establishes or resumes a task-handoff drawer, it records the drawer's own task-handoff key with a declaration record named `protocol` (R3). This write happens before any task work in the session begins, establishing channel 4 as a fallback for records captured later in that session.

The session-start protocol documentation — `artifacts/core/rules/60-tools.md` → *Memory Activation Protocol* → *Session Start — Deterministic status-first sweep* and `~/.crewrig/system-context/long-running-task-convention.md` — now names requirement 3's recording step explicitly (R4).

## Prune

The explicit, period-scoped prune (R17, spec 0207 requirement 18) removes the journal entries and ledger entries recorded within a pruned period together:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-prune.sh <cli> <YYYY-MM>
```

This command removes:

1. Every journal entry in the period (with its wing sidecar and attribution sidecar).
2. Every mirrored drawer corresponding to a journal entry in the period.
3. **Every ledger entry whose own timestamp falls within the period** (R17, spec 0207 delta-01 R28).

The period is derived from each record's own `timing.requestInstant`, not `timing.captureInstant`. Ledger entries are keyed by their own `timestamp`'s `YYYY-MM` component. Both are pruned together, leaving neither behind on its own.

After a period is pruned, writes to that period are rejected by default (records are marked as rejected). To restore writability without recovering deleted records:

```bash
bash scripts/usage-prune.sh <cli> <YYYY-MM> --unprune
```

This removes only the pruned marker, allowing new writes to the period again. Rejected records from while the period was pruned remain lost; to recover them, backfill cursors must be reset.

### Purge instructions

The prune above removes one period. Removing all attribution data at once (every declaration record, the whole ledger, and every `.attr.json` sidecar) is part of removing everything the feature holds, described once in [Removing usage data](usage-organization.md#removing-usage-data) in the organization note.

## Personal data

### What attribution carries

- **Declaration records** — A task-handoff key (textual identifier) and/or an external asset reference (forge issue, Jira key, or file path/URL). No user identity or personal information beyond the task name itself.
- **Ledger entries** — The author of the entry (the operator's name or a role identifier), a timestamp, a reason (a short text explaining the retroactive change), and a task-handoff key and/or external asset reference.

A task-handoff key may be numerical (a ticket number like `1171`) or a named task identifier; an external asset reference may identify a forge issue, a Jira ticket, or a shared document. These are work-tracking identifiers, not personal data themselves, but they may reveal what a person was working on and when.

Retention, who can read declarations, ledger entries, and sidecars, and how to remove them are stated once for the whole feature, in the [organization note](usage-organization.md).
