# Usage capture architecture and mechanisms

<!-- crewrig-doc: section=reference nav_order=115 published=true title="Usage capture architecture" -->

The usage-capture seam implements spec 0206, deriving one usage record for every completed model-request a CLI source records, plus one summary record for every non-interactive CLI invocation. This page documents the capture architecture, the per-CLI adapter mechanics, the cursor semantics, the in-repo-absolute-path installation contract, and the documented gaps.

This page is one stage of the usage feature; the [usage architecture overview](usage-overview.md) shows how the stages fit together.

## Architecture overview

The capture step is a **Node module tree** under `scripts/lib/usage-capture/`, invoked by two thin entry points:

- **Live capture:** `hooks/usage-capture.sh` — a sibling hook to `hooks/mempalace-transcript.sh`, wired by in-repo absolute path into the existing `Stop` / `SessionEnd` / `AfterModel` / `agentStop` events on Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, and Antigravity (statusline display). On every CLI it is enabled by a **usage-capture opt-in of its own**, independent from the MemPalace session-recording opt-in in both directions (spec 0211): capture works on a machine where MemPalace is absent, and session recording works without capture. The question defaults to `no`; once capture is registered it becomes `keep`/`remove`, and `remove` is the removal path (see *Shim wiring* below; Antigravity keeps its statusline opt-in and removal of spec 0206 R20–R21).
- **Backfill:** `scripts/usage-backfill.sh` — a command-line tool that replays the same per-CLI adapters against records already present on a machine, taking the same derivation rules the live path uses.

No storage backend, write format, or retention policy is implemented by this specification (spec 0206 R25). The capture module exposes a pure interface `sink.submit(record) → { status: 'stored' | 'duplicate' | 'rejected', reason? }` — the three outcomes spec 0207 R24 defines — and resolves to spec 0207's own storage contract: `scripts/lib/usage-store/journal.js`'s `write(record)` (see [Usage storage](usage-storage.md)). The hand-over from spec 0206's original spool is complete (see *Spool hand-over to spec 0207* below); a machine that ran 0206 before the hand-over has any leftover `~/.crewrig/usage/spool/` files drained into the journal on the next write, and `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT` is unchanged throughout.

## Per-adapter field sources

Every captured record declares a `formatFingerprint` — a hash of the asserted key-path set, not its content — so a fixture and a live source of the same generation carry the same fingerprint. An unrecognized generation yields an `uncaptured` record naming the mismatch.

### Claude Code

Source: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl` + `<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`

Fidelity: `per-request`

| Field | Source | Derivation | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provenance.cli` | Static | `"claude-code"` |  |
| `provenance.cliVersion` | Entry field | `message.version` — fallback `"unknown"` if absent | Identifies the CLI version that served the request |
| `provenance.captureChannel` | Static | `"own-record-tail"` | Captured from the session record's tail |
| `provenance.formatFingerprint` | Assertion result | SHA256 of sorted `["message.usage.input_tokens", "message.usage.output_tokens"]` | Detects format changes across generations |
| `identity.sessionId` | Entry field | `sessionId` (fallback `session_id`) | The session identifier from the record |
| `identity.projectRoot` | Entry field | `cwd` — fallback to caller-provided `cwd` | The working directory at request time |
| `identity.agentId` | Entry field | `agentId` on subagent records, explicitly `null` on main-session records | A Claude Code subagent record carries the **parent's** `sessionId` in its own `sessionId` field; there is no distinct child session id |
| `identity.parentSessionId` | Static | `null` | Satisfied by fields, never by file adjacency |
| `timing.requestInstant` | Entry field | `timestamp` — fallback to capture time if absent | When the request occurred |
| `modelId` | Entry field | `message.model` — fallback `"unknown"` | The literal model identifier reported by the CLI |
| `interaction` | Derived | From `agentId` (agent-internal), `stop_reason` (`tool_use` → tool-continuation, other → user-turn), fallback `unknown` | Signals the newest input's shape |
| `tokens.netInput` | Entry field | `usage.input_tokens` | Total input tokens |
| `tokens.cacheRead` | Entry field | `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` | Tokens read from cache |
| `tokens.cacheWrite` | Entry field | `usage.cache_creation.{ephemeral_5m,ephemeral_1h}_input_tokens` as a structured object, fallback to `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` | Cache write tiers are preserved per spec 0206 R9 |
| `tokens.output` | Entry field | `usage.output_tokens` | Tokens generated |
| `tokens.reasoning` | Entry field | `usage.output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens` — zero if absent | Thinking tokens (when present) |
| `raw` | Subset | `{ usage, stop_reason }` | Only the enumerated key paths; never `message.content` |
| `rawStatus` | Static | `"complete"` | The full raw block is present |
| `idempotencyKey` | Entry field | `requestId`, fallback to `uuid` | **All entries sharing one `requestId` collapse into one record** (spec 0206 R6); the last entry for a key wins |

**Key collapse (R6 streaming duplicates):** When multiple entries share the same `requestId`, the adapter emits exactly one record, with field values from the last entry. This occurs when a model response is delivered in streaming chunks, each reported as a completed entry. Probed on the authoring machine: 25.8% of interactive `entrypoint: "cli"` records lack `requestId` and fall back to `uuid`.

### Gemini CLI

Source: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/<sessionId>.{json,jsonl}` (three generations) + `chats/<sessionId>/<sub>.jsonl` (subagent) + `projects.json` (project root reverse index)

Fidelity: `per-request`

| Field | Source | Derivation | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provenance.cli` | Static | `"gemini-cli"` |  |
| `provenance.cliVersion` | Memoized subprocess | `gemini --version` — cached by binary mtime/size, written to `~/.crewrig/usage/state/gemini-cli/version.json` | Not present in the session record; resolved once per binary upgrade |
| `provenance.captureChannel` | Static | `"own-record-tail"` |  |
| `provenance.formatFingerprint` | Assertion result | SHA256 of sorted key paths corresponding to the generation: legacy `.json` (no `kind`), `.json` with `kind` (plus a virtual `container.json` key path), or `.jsonl` `$set`-patch (plus a virtual `container.jsonl` key path) | Detects schema changes; three generations supported. The virtual `container.json`/`container.jsonl` key paths carry the container-shape fact `deriveFromFile` already resolves from the file extension — never an optional field like `summary`, which the CLI fills in asynchronously and is absent on roughly half of live `kind`-carrying sessions (i2-F1) |
| `identity.sessionId` | Header field | Transcript header's own `sessionId` |  |
| `identity.projectRoot` | Reverse index | `~/.gemini/projects.json` structure: `{"projects": {"<absolute path>": "<short name>", …}}` — lookup the header's `projectHash` against the nested `projects` keys | On backfill, `projectHash` is re-verified to match via `sha256()` |
| `identity.agentId` | Static | `null` — no field in the source carries it | See `parentSessionId` below |
| `identity.parentSessionId` | Static | `null` for subagent records — the source exposes no parent-session field | The enclosing directory name is a human-readable hint but not an authoritative identifier; it rides in `raw.sourceDirectory` and is documented as a gap |
| `timing.requestInstant` | Entry field | Response entry's `timestamp` |  |
| `modelId` | Entry field | Response entry's model name — fallback `"unknown"` | The literal model identifier |
| `interaction` | Derived | From `toolCalls` presence: if present → `tool-continuation`, otherwise → `user-turn` | The `tool_use` stop reason is not available in Gemini's output format |
| `tokens.netInput` | Computed | `tokens.input − tokens.cached` — the unreduced `input` is preserved in `raw` | Spec 0206 R7: net input is the combined count minus the cached count |
| `tokens.cacheRead` | Entry field | `tokens.cached` |  |
| `tokens.cacheWrite` | Static | `0` — Gemini's own record reports no cache write | The capture path is request-level; cache writes (if tracked at all) are session-level metadata |
| `tokens.output` | Entry field | `tokens.output` |  |
| `tokens.reasoning` | Entry field | `tokens.thinking` — zero if absent |  |
| `raw` | Subset | Enumerated fields plus the unreduced `input` count | Never `content` or `thoughts` fields |
| `rawStatus` | Static | `"complete"` |  |
| `idempotencyKey` | Entry field | Response entry's message `id` |  |

**Generations supported:**

- **Legacy monolithic `<sessionId>.json`:** A single JSON object carrying a `kind` field (or missing it for pre-`kind` installations)
- **Generation 2 `<sessionId>.json` with `kind`:** The header gains a `kind` field (`summary` sometimes rides along too, but it is filled in asynchronously by the Gemini CLI and is not asserted by the fingerprint — i2-F1); entries remain the same shape
- **Generation 3 `<sessionId>.jsonl`:** The file becomes a JSONL journal of `$set`-patch operations. The adapter reduces the patches to entry state before emitting.

**Subagent mystery:** The specification requires that every subagent-linkage value come from a field the source assigns (spec 0206 R12). Gemini CLI's subagent transcripts (`chats/<parentSessionId>/<sub>.jsonl`) carry a header with `directories[0]` and a parent-directory enclosure, but no `parentSessionId` field in the header itself. The parent linkage is therefore preserved in `raw.sourceDirectory` and documented as a gap (see *Documented gaps* below).

### Copilot CLI

Source: `~/.copilot/session-store.db` (SQLite, schema version 8+) + `~/.copilot/session-state/<sessionId>/events.jsonl` (version string only)

Fidelity: `per-request`

| Field | Source | Derivation | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provenance.cli` | Static | `"copilot-cli"` |  |
| `provenance.cliVersion` | Two-path resolver | **Live path:** First line of `session-state/<sessionId>/events.jsonl`, field `session.start.data.copilotVersion` (present on 84 of 84 test installations) — fallback to memoized `copilot --version`. **Backfill path (caveat):** Memoized `copilot --version` only, stamping the binary present *today* onto rows an *older* binary may have served. Schema-valid either way; the asymmetry is documented here. | The store itself contains no version field |
| `provenance.captureChannel` | Static | `"sqlite-assistant-usage-events"` | Captured from the SQLite journal table |
| `provenance.formatFingerprint` | Assertion result | Hash of `schema_version` + sorted `assistant_usage_events` column set | Schema changes (e.g., Copilot auto-update from v7 to v8) are detected |
| `identity.sessionId` | Row field | `session_id` from `assistant_usage_events` |  |
| `identity.projectRoot` | Join | `sessions.cwd` (selected **only**, never the adjacent `sessions.summary` which holds conversational content) | Joined on `session_id` |
| `identity.agentId` | Row field | `agent_id` — `null` on top-level rows | Identifies subordinate-agent calls |
| `identity.parentSessionId` | Static | `null` — no parent-session column exists | The store carries `parent_tool_call_id` (preserved in `raw`), not a parent-session identifier |
| `timing.requestInstant` | Row field | `created_at` (ISO 8601 string) |  |
| `modelId` | Row field | `model` column — authoritative across mid-session model changes | The literal model identifier |
| `interaction` | Derived | From `initiator` field | Values map to interaction classes per the schema |
| `tokens.netInput` | Row field | `input_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.cacheRead` | Row field | `cache_read_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.cacheWrite` | Row field | `cache_write_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.output` | Row field | `output_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.reasoning` | Row field | `reasoning_tokens` — zero if column absent (pre-v8 schema) |  |
| `raw` | Subset | Selected row fields plus `parent_tool_call_id` | Never `messages` or conversation content |
| `rawStatus` | Static | `"complete"` |  |
| `idempotencyKey` | Row field | `id` (the row's unique identifier) |  |

**SQLite read mechanics:** The adapter opens `session-store.db` with `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync(path, { readOnly: true })`. If the read-only open fails (a WAL whose `.shm` cannot be attached), it retries once against a temp copy of `.db`, `.db-wal`, and `.db-shm` together. An unavailable `node:sqlite` or a second failure yields one `uncaptured` record.

### Antigravity CLI

Source: `statusLine.command` — a display-refresh payload delivered to a captured statusline hook

Fidelity: `session-cumulative`

| Field | Source | Derivation | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provenance.cli` | Static | `"antigravity"` |  |
| `provenance.cliVersion` | Payload field | `version` — no subprocess | Reported in the statusline payload itself |
| `provenance.captureChannel` | Static | `"statusline-shim"` | Captured from the live display channel |
| `provenance.formatFingerprint` | Assertion result | Hash of cumulative-usage key set | Detects payload shape changes |
| `identity.sessionId` | Payload field | `session_id` — `conversation_id` rides in `raw` | The channel exposes both; `session_id` is chosen for consistency |
| `identity.projectRoot` | Payload field | `workspace.project_dir` |  |
| `identity.agentId` | Static | `null` — the channel exposes no agent linkage |  |
| `identity.parentSessionId` | Static | `null` |  |
| `timing.requestInstant` | Derived | The payload's own snapshot instant — **note:** Antigravity's statusline channel does **not** report a timestamp, so `requestInstant` equals `captureInstant` | See *Documented gaps* below |
| `modelId` | Payload field | `model.id` — preserved **verbatim**, including display labels like `"Gemini 3.8 Flash (Medium)"` | Spec 0206 R30: never a value borrowed from another source |
| `interaction` | Static | `"unknown"` | Spec 0206 R11: session-cumulative fidelity carries no per-request distinction |
| `tokens.netInput` | Payload field | `context_window.current_usage.input_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.cacheRead` | Payload field | `context_window.current_usage.cache_read_input_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.cacheWrite` | Payload field | `context_window.current_usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.output` | Payload field | `context_window.current_usage.output_tokens` |  |
| `tokens.reasoning` | Static | `0` — Antigravity's usage channel carries no reasoning-token field | Specification R8: zero when the source genuinely did not report |
| `raw` | Subset | Cumulative-usage fields plus `conversation_id` | Never the full statusline display |
| `rawStatus` | Static | `"complete"` |  |
| `idempotencyKey` | Derived | `sha256(session_id + snapshot_instant)` — derived because no per-request identifier exists | Spec 0206 R5: keying on session + instant instead of a per-request id |

**Payload-delivery mechanism:** The hook `hooks/antigravity-statusline-shim.sh` is wired into `statusLine.command` of `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` (only when that value is empty; see *Installation contract* below). The shim forwards the payload to the adapter and prints the status line unchanged, so the user-visible display is unaffected.

**Cumulative firing pattern:** The statusline channel fires ten times for one `agy -p` invocation, with progressively richer payloads. The adapter emits a record only when the cumulative token counters differ from the cursor's prior snapshot. This buys **exactly one thing, and no more: a firing whose counters have not moved derives no record.** It does not buy one record per turn. If the counters move multiple times within one turn, multiple records are derived (legal per spec 0206 R5: the fidelity declaration is `session-cumulative`, and the key includes the snapshot instant precisely because the channel carries no per-request identifier).

### Headless envelope (run-total, all CLIs)

Source: Structured summary from `--output-format json` / `--usage-output-file` / equivalent non-interactive output

Fidelity: `run-total`

| Field | Source | Derivation | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provenance.cli` | Caller-provided | The CLI that was invoked (claude-code, gemini-cli, copilot-cli, antigravity) |  |
| `provenance.cliVersion` | Memoized subprocess | Per-CLI binary version resolver; same cache as per-request adapters | Cached by binary mtime/size in `~/.crewrig/usage/state/<cli>/version.json` |
| `provenance.captureChannel` | Static | `"headless-envelope"` |  |
| `provenance.formatFingerprint` | Static | `"headless-envelope-run-total"` | Envelope shape varies per CLI but is not generation-mutable within one run |
| `identity.sessionId` | Envelope field | Extracted per CLI; fallback to `run-total-unreported:<launch_instant>` | Claude Code and Copilot report one; Antigravity uses `conversation_id` instead; Gemini may or may not report one depending on the envelope |
| `identity.projectRoot` | Caller-provided | The launching shell's working directory | Owned by the caller (step 15 wrapper) |
| `identity.agentId` | Static | `null` |  |
| `identity.parentSessionId` | Static | `null` |  |
| `timing.requestInstant` | Envelope field | `terminal_timestamp` / `timestamp` when the envelope carries one, fallback to `launchInstant` recorded by the caller **before** the run | The timing is recorded before run and adjusted if the envelope reports a terminal timestamp |
| `modelId` | Envelope field | Per-CLI extraction; **Antigravity and Copilot terminal event both report no model**, so those land on the sentinel `"(unreported)"` — never a value borrowed from another source | Spec 0206 R30 enforced: the value is either from the envelope or the sentinel |
| `interaction` | Static | `"unknown"` | Run-total fidelity carries no per-request distinction |
| `tokens` | Envelope field | Extracted per CLI from the run's final usage summary; zero when the envelope names no value | All five classes are populated from the envelope shape; zero is schema-valid when the source genuinely reports nothing |
| `raw` | Subset | Per-CLI allow-list of top-level envelope keys, each copied unaltered when present: Antigravity `conversation_id`, `status`, `duration_seconds`, `num_turns`, `usage`; Claude Code `session_id`, `modelUsage`, `usage`, `total_cost_usd`, `duration_ms`, `num_turns`; Gemini CLI `session_id` and `stats` reduced to `stats.models`; Copilot CLI `currentModel`, `modelMetrics`, `pricing`, `total_nano_aiu`, `request_multiplier`; any other CLI `session_id`, `sessionId`, `model`, `usage`. Every CLI also keeps `timestamp` and `terminal_timestamp` | Never `response`, `result`, or other conversation text (spec 0206 R18) |
| `rawStatus` | Static | `"complete"` |  |
| `idempotencyKey` | Derived | `run-total:<sessionId>` when a session id is present, fallback to `run-total:sha256(launch_instant + argv_digest)` | Keys are stable across re-runs of the same invocation; the fallback avoids collisions between run-total and per-request keys |

## Usage root directory

The capture system stores all persistent state under a **usage root** directory, configurable via the `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT` environment variable:

```text
export CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT=/path/to/custom/root  # Optional; default is ${HOME}/.crewrig/usage
```

**Default:** `${HOME}/.crewrig/usage`

**Subdirectories:** Under the usage root, the capture system creates and maintains:

- `state/<cli>/` — Cursor files (high-water markers), stamp sidecars, memoized `version.json` per CLI, and configuration like `antigravity-statusline.json` (cursor-owned, never pruned by spec 0207)
- `journal/`, `mirror/`, `cache/`, `pruned/`, `locks/`, `tmp/` — spec 0207's own storage contract; see [Usage storage](usage-storage.md) for the full layout
- `spool/` — legacy directory from spec 0206's original hand-over buffer; present only on a machine that ran 0206 before the hand-over, and drained into the journal on the next write

**Specification 0207 coordination:** The 0207 implementation honors the same `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT` variable throughout — the capture step and the storage contract share one root and one `state/` directory.

**Testing:** When running tests, `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT` is pointed at a temporary directory (`mktemp -d`) to avoid interfering with the operator's own `~/.crewrig/usage/` directory.

## Cursor semantics and the stamp sidecar

Per-source high-water state lives at `<usage root>/state/<cli>/<sourceKey>.json`, holding:

```json
{
  "byteOffset": 0,
  "headDigest": "sha256(first 4096 bytes)",
  "pendingUnitIds": [],
  "maxRowId": 0,
  "lastSnapshotDigest": null
}
```

**Source key derivation:** `sha256(<absolute source path>)` — the same derivation both the hook and the adapters use, kept in sync by inspection.

**Head digest mechanism:** If the first 4096 bytes of the source change (file rotation, truncation, or overwrite), the digest mismatches and the adapter resets `byteOffset` to 0, re-deriving from the file's beginning. This detects when the journal file has been replaced rather than appended to.

**Stamp sidecar:** After a successful capture pass, a zero-byte file `<sourceKey>.stamp` is touched (via `utimes()`) to the source's own mtime. The hook's fast path uses a bash `-nt` test: `[[ "$src" -nt "$stamp" ]]` costs nothing (builtin mtime comparison) and skips Node entirely when nothing new has appeared. This sidecar is the fast path's only visible artifact on the filesystem.

**Backfill idempotence:** A second backfill run over the same source set adds zero new records, because the sink's recordId-based dedup (via `fs.linkSync()`) recognizes records already written to the journal.

**Spec 0207 prune rule:** The 0207 implementation's prune-by-period command SHALL NOT touch `~/.crewrig/usage/state/`. Resetting a cursor would make the next backfill re-derive pruned records, defeating the retention policy. The state directory is cursor-owned and off-limits.

## Installation contract: in-repo absolute-path wiring

The capture step is wired by **in-repo absolute path**, never copied into any CLI's home directory. This is the same treatment `hooks/worktree-git-guard.sh` already carries.

### Shim wiring (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI)

Each CLI's interactive setup asks a usage-capture question of its own (spec 0211), after its session-recording block and whatever that block's answer was. It is never gated on MemPalace: the capture command carries no MemPalace setting, and its records go to the file-system journal of spec 0207.

The registered entries come from one **capture fragment** per CLI, holding exactly the capture events (spec 0206 R13–R14) and nothing else:

- **Claude Code:** `hooks/claude-usage-capture-hooks.json` — `Stop` and `SessionEnd`, in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Gemini CLI:** `hooks/gemini-usage-capture-hooks.json` — `AfterModel`, in `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- **Copilot CLI:** `hooks/copilot-usage-capture-hooks.json` — `agentStop` and `sessionEnd`, in `~/.copilot/hooks/copilot-transcript-hooks.json` (the user-level file session recording also uses)

The transcript manifests (`hooks/*-transcript-hooks.json`) no longer carry a capture entry, so accepting session recording registers no capture command. Before writing, setup substitutes the fragment's tokenized script path (`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/hooks/usage-capture.sh`, `${GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/usage-capture.sh`, `${COPILOT_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/hooks/usage-capture.sh`) with the in-repo absolute path that `usage_capture_abs` computes: the physical (`pwd -P`) path of the checkout's `hooks/usage-capture.sh`. Every fragment keeps that path inside double quotes, so a checkout path with a space works. A checkout path holding `"`, `$`, a backtick, a backslash or a newline would change the meaning of the command, so setup refuses it and writes nothing.

The question depends on what is already registered. A capture command is recognised by its whole shape: an optional `bash` (or `sh`, or environment assignments) followed by a script path ending in `/hooks/usage-capture.sh`, then exactly the arguments `<cli-id> <Event>`, where `<cli-id>` is `claude-code`, `gemini-cli` or `copilot-cli`. The path may be double-quoted, single-quoted or unquoted, and may point anywhere. This covers every form crewrig wrote, including the former coupled deployment's commands inside the session-recording opt-in and its unquoted Gemini form. An operator hook that runs a script of the same name with other arguments is not a capture command: setup never counts, keeps, re-points or removes it.

- **Nothing registered:** `no`/`yes`, default `no`. Setup first discloses the events, the path, the file it changes, that no prompt or response text is recorded, and that MemPalace is not required. An empty or canceled answer is `no`: nothing is written, and setup prints how to enable capture later.
- **Already registered:** `keep`/`remove`, default `keep`.
  - `keep` leaves exactly one capture command per event. When an event holds several, it keeps one whose path resolves in preference to one whose path is gone. It re-points a command only when its path no longer resolves, and says so. A path setup cannot judge (relative, or holding `$` or `~` that only the hook's shell expands) is never treated as gone and is left as it is. It writes nothing when nothing needs to change.
  - `remove` backs the file up, deletes every capture command, and deletes a matcher group or an event key only when that deletion emptied it. Every other entry is as it was. When enable created the file, the file stays, holding the empty shell capture was added to (`{}` on Claude Code and Gemini CLI, `{"version": 1, "hooks": {}}` on Copilot CLI).

Every read and write of a capture entry lives in `scripts/lib/usage-capture-optin.sh`. Each write backs up an existing file first, goes through `write_json_config_secure` (the file ends 0600), and leaves every other hook entry and every non-hook setting as it was. Backups are owner-only too: `backup_file` creates each one at 0600 and narrows the earlier `<file>.bak.*` copies the user owns to 0600, since a configuration may hold the MemPalace bearer token. The session-recording opt-in writes through the same library, so it never removes, duplicates or re-points a registered capture command.

On Gemini CLI, setup merges `~/.gemini/settings.json` in place (spec 0214): it never rebuilds the file from its template, so every hook entry survives a re-run whatever the answers. Registered capture entries are kept by the merge itself, with no separate carry-over. A re-run that declines (or cancels) session recording leaves the session-recording hooks and the worktree git guard an earlier run registered in place, and setup says so, as Claude Code and Copilot CLI do on the same re-run.

The shim **is never copied** to `~/.claude/hooks/`, `~/.gemini/hooks/`, or `~/.copilot/hooks/`. Its whole job is to reach `scripts/lib/usage-capture/`, so it lives at the repository path where that module tree is a sibling.

### Statusline shim wiring (Antigravity CLI)

The `hooks/antigravity-statusline-shim.sh` is installed into `statusLine.command` of `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` **only when that value is empty** (spec 0206 R20). The prior value and a "framework-installed" marker are recorded in `~/.crewrig/usage/state/antigravity-statusline.json`. Removal restores exactly the prior value (spec 0206 R21).

The shim is **not copied** to `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`; it lives at its in-repo absolute path, computed the same way:

```bash
STATUSLINE_ABS="$(cd "$(dirname "$SRC")" && pwd -P)/$(basename "$SRC")"
```

### Checkout-location dependency

Moving, renaming, or deleting the checkout breaks the wired absolute path. The triggering CLI then sees a non-zero status from a command that never started, and no capture runs.

**This is the accepted cost of the in-repo absolute path** — the same cost `hooks/worktree-git-guard.sh` carries since spec 0169. Mitigations, in order of operator experience:

0. **Linked-worktree protection:** Each installer calls `warn_if_linked_worktree` and warns when the checkout is a linked git worktree (detected via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` differing from `.git`). The warning message is:

   ```text
   WARNING: this checkout is a linked git worktree (<path>).
            The usage capture wiring above points INTO this checkout — running
            'git worktree remove' on it breaks the wired hook silently
            until this installer is re-run against a durable checkout.
   ```

   **Recommendation:** Run the installers from the main checkout, not from a linked worktree created via `git worktree add`.

1. Each installer prints the wired absolute path at install time, so the dependency is disclosed rather than discovered.
2. `docs/usage-capture.md` (this file) states the dependency and names the recovery: re-run the installer from a durable checkout. On Claude Code, Gemini CLI and Copilot CLI, answering `keep` at the usage-capture question re-points a registered command whose path no longer resolves at that checkout's capture script, and reports each re-pointed path (spec 0211 R11).
3. The data itself is recoverable regardless: `scripts/usage-backfill.sh --reset-cursors` re-derives from the CLIs' own durable history everything a dead live path missed.

## Backfill command

```bash
bash scripts/usage-backfill.sh [--reset-cursors]
```

**Flags:**

- `--reset-cursors`: Clear `<usage root>/state/<cli>/` (cursor files, stamp sidecars, and memoized versions) so a machine whose journal was discarded can re-derive from the CLIs' own durable history. The true record of source is the CLIs themselves, and this flag lets you recover from a lost journal.

**Output:**

The command prints a per-CLI summary:

```text
claude-code: 27,013 stored, 3 duplicate, 0 rejected
gemini-cli: 2,664 stored, 1 duplicate, 0 rejected
copilot-cli: 2,885 stored, 2 duplicate, 0 rejected
```

**Idempotence:** Running the backfill a second time against unchanged source history reports 0 stored and the full duplicate count, proving deduplication is working.

**Recovery use case:** If the live hook path breaks (e.g., checkout moved), run the backfill to re-derive everything the live path missed.

## Attribution resolution and the sidecar

When `submit(record, ctx)` hands the record to the storage contract, the record's attribution is resolved from one of four ordered channels (spec 0208 R1): explicit human declaration, the `CREWRIG_TASK` environment variable, the current worktree or branch, or the session-start protocol. Attribution is a **one-time resolution** — once resolved at hand-over, it is never re-derived, and the journal entry itself stays byte-identical to what capture produced (spec 0208 R16).

The resolving channel and its outcome (attributed or unattributed, with failure reason if validation failed) are recorded in a `.attr.json` sidecar beside the journal entry, for durable, inspectable audit without mutating the record schema (which closes on exactly `taskHandoffKey` and `externalAsset` fields). Backfill performs the same resolution over historical records, using the same pure `resolveAttribution(record, ctx)` function; context for backfill sets `declarations: false` and `cwd: null` to disable the live channels (channels 1, 3, 4) and resolve only from `CREWRIG_TASK`, so a historical record has no attribution unless the environment explicitly provides one.

See [Usage attribution](usage-attribution.md) for the full contract, the channels, the declaration record, the ledger, and rollup surfaces.

## Spool hand-over to spec 0207

The hand-over is complete. `scripts/lib/usage-capture/sink.js` writes each captured record straight through the storage contract (`scripts/lib/usage-store/journal.js`'s `write(record)`) — no adapter or hook changed in the process, and `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT` is the same root throughout.

Before this hand-over, captured records were written to `~/.crewrig/usage/spool/<recordId>.json`, one file per record, verbatim, with no index, partition scheme, retention policy, or prune ledger. That original buffer, `spool.js`, is deleted. A machine that ran 0206's capture step before the hand-over may still carry leftover files under `~/.crewrig/usage/spool/`; the journal's own `drainAndSweep()` drains them into the journal on its first write per process, deleting each spooled file only after that record's journal write returns `stored` or `duplicate` — nothing captured under 0206 is lost.

## Adopted launch sites (non-interactive runs)

These framework-owned launch sites have been adopted to emit one `run-total` record per invocation:

| Script | Location | Mechanism | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scripts/probe-extension-mcp-token.sh` | Line 143 | Copilot CLI with `--usage-output-file` side channel | Live run verified; output unchanged |
| `scripts/probe-extension-mcp-token.sh` | Line 237 | Antigravity CLI with `--output-format json` + `.response` rewrite | Calibrated against real Antigravity payloads |
| `scripts/probe-antigravity-discovery.sh` | `probe_ask()` primitive | Antigravity CLI with `--output-format json` + `.response` rewrite | Isolated harness verified against stub payloads |
| `scripts/probe-extension-hooks.sh` | Lines ~206, ~235, ~256 | Copilot CLI with `--usage-output-file` | Live run verified; verdict unchanged |

**Excluded sites (with reasons):**

- `mcp list` / `mcp get` / `--version` invocations across all probe scripts — no model call, therefore no usage envelope.
- Vendor-action runs in `.github/workflows/claude.yml` and `.github/workflows/copilot.yml` — outside the framework's shell boundary; the two workflows that exist on commit `39a81c6`.
- e2e harness (`tests/e2e/lib/test-*.sh`, scenario runners) — all wrapped in `docker run --rm` against a container-internal `$HOME` that is deleted at exit. Mounting `~/.crewrig/usage` would break the harness's own isolation contract.

## Documented gaps

### Spec 0206 R22: Antigravity per-request and per-agent granularity

Antigravity's own session record exposes **no field that a token count can be tied to with confidence**. The capture seam therefore reads from the statusline channel instead, which yields session-cumulative records (`fidelity: "session-cumulative"`), not per-request ones.

**Evidence** (the full chain is also recorded in `docs/cli-matrix.md` → *Parity gaps* → usage-capture granularity; each link is independent):

1. **No hook payload carries usage.** The vendor's own `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/builtin/skills/agy-customizations/docs/hooks.md`, read field by field, lists no token or model field on any event (#1167 triage).
2. **The session store is opaque.** The per-conversation store a hook's `transcriptPath` points at is sqlite whose payload columns are protobuf blobs with no shipped `.proto`; no field could be tied to a token count with confidence (#1167, #1169). This adapter does not read it.
3. **No local telemetry exporter.** Telemetry is outbound-only (`enableTelemetry`, internal `AnalyticsService`) and the binary carries no `OTEL_*` string (#1167).
4. **Independent upstream reproduction.** On [google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#366](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/issues/366) ("Support Gemini CLI-compatible OTLP/OpenTelemetry token usage export", open as of 2026-09-24, no maintainer decision), a [2026-07-31 comment](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/issues/366#issuecomment-5140583537) reproduces the gap with commands and outputs: `agy --output-format=json --print="…"` returns a `usage` object for a print-mode run (the run-total the headless envelope channel already captures), `--log-file` output holds zero `token` or `usage` matches, the `conversations/*.db` payload columns are protobuf blobs in which only one of five known token counts could be located, and `OTEL_*` variables produce nothing — "interactive use is not measurable by any route I could find".

`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` is Antigravity's *configuration* file, the same file `statusLine.command` is wired into (see *Payload-delivery mechanism* above); it is not a session or conversation record, and `conversation_id` is a field of the statusline payload itself (see the field table above). The statusline payload is therefore the only usage-bearing channel this adapter has, and it names no per-request or per-turn identifier. Revisit when #366 ships.

### Gemini CLI trigger measurement

The Gemini capture step rides `AfterModel` only; `AfterAgent` stays unregistered (spec 0206 R14: an extra end-of-turn event only after a measurement shows `AfterModel` insufficient). The measurements behind that choice, from the spec 0206 pre-freeze probes on #1169:

- **Probe 1** — `AfterModel` fires **5 times per prompt** (streaming chunks); its payload carries only partial `usageMetadata`, so the session record stays the source and the hook is the trigger.
- **Probe 7** — a full re-parse of the largest source measured costs **~142–168 ms** worst case (a Claude Code session deduplicated to 3,376 records). No Gemini-specific re-parse timing was taken; the figure is the cross-CLI worst case.
- **PLAN v3 estimates, not probe results** — Node start-up adds an estimated **~40–60 ms** per spawn, and the bash `-nt` stamp test (see *Cursor semantics and the stamp sidecar*) is expected to keep 4 of the 5 firings from spawning Node. That 4-of-5 figure is a PLAN v3 assumption, not a measurement. The fast path compares modification times (`hooks/usage-capture.sh`: the source must not be newer than its stamp), not record content, so any write to the session file during the turn, the user's own message included, sends that firing down the slow path. Neither figure was measured.

A Gemini-specific timing that shows the per-firing cost too high is the measurement R14 names; until one exists, registering `AfterAgent` would be an unmeasured extra event.

### OpenTelemetry oracle — abandoned

Spec 0206 → *Out of scope* deferred native OpenTelemetry export, as an oracle or enrichment layer, to a later ticket. That ticket was not opened: the user ratified abandoning it on #1174 (2026-09-24, recorded on epic #1166). Reasons:

- It covers at most two CLIs of four: Claude Code has no file exporter (an OTLP receiver process would be needed) and Antigravity exposes none (see the R22 evidence above).
- #1169 probe 9 showed Gemini's `telemetry.outfile` is concatenated raw SDK objects, not OTLP; its Gemini-specific `token.usage` metric dropped a second model's points in an auto-routed turn, so only the `gemini_cli.api_response` events (which do carry all six token fields) could serve, through one more bespoke parser; and `logPrompts` defaults to `true`, writing response text to disk unless overridden.
- Enabling it repurposes the user's own CLI telemetry configuration.

Copilot CLI does ship such an exporter (`COPILOT_OTEL_FILE_EXPORTER_PATH`, content capture off by default), but it reports the same vendor accounting the adapter already reads per call from `assistant_usage_events`, so as an oracle it would only catch a silent semantic drift. Shape drift stays covered by the per-generation fixtures (spec 0206 R27) and `uncaptured` emission on an unknown fingerprint. **Reopen condition:** a drift in a CLI's own record reaches the store undetected by the fingerprint and fixture guard (a mis-derived record found after the fact), or Claude Code ships a local file exporter — whichever comes first.

### Gemini subagent parent-session linkage

Gemini CLI's subagent transcripts are stored in subdirectories (`chats/<parentSessionId>/<sub>.jsonl`), but the transcript header carries no `parentSessionId` field. The enclosing directory name is a human-readable hint but not an authoritative identifier.

**Evidence:** Spec 0206 R12 requires the value to come from a field the source assigns, never from file adjacency. The source does not carry it. The directory name is preserved in `raw.sourceDirectory` for human audit, and this gap is documented here.

### Headless envelopes naming no model

Antigravity CLI's run-total envelope and Copilot CLI's terminal `result` event both omit a `model` field. When `envelope.model` is absent, the record carries the sentinel `"(unreported)"`, never a value borrowed from another source (spec 0206 R30).

**Evidence:** Live runs verified on both CLIs on 2026-09-21. An unreported model is schema-valid, and downstream seams (pricing, attribution) must handle the sentinel.

### Antigravity requestInstant equals captureInstant

Antigravity's statusline channel does not report a snapshot timestamp. Therefore, `timing.requestInstant` is set to the capture instant (when the hook read the payload), not the instant the snapshot was taken.

**Evidence:** The statusline payload carries only the current snapshot data, no timestamp field. This is observable and documented rather than guessed.

### Copilot CLI cliVersion backfill caveat

On the live path, `provenance.cliVersion` comes from the first line of `session-state/<sessionId>/events.jsonl` — the version **that served the call**. On backfill, when that file is absent (16 of 100 test installations), the value is resolved from the memoized `copilot --version` — **the version present today**, which may differ from the version that served the row.

**Evidence:** Copilot CLI auto-updates without operator action; the store on this machine moved from schema v7 to v8 during the authoring window. The value is schema-valid either way, never a token count, and the asymmetry is documented here.

## Personal-data note

This section states what the capture seam itself keeps. What a usage record holds, and never holds, is stated in [Usage storage → Personal data](usage-storage.md#personal-data).

- **Capture state.** `<usage root>/state/` holds the per-source cursors and stamp sidecars (read positions in each CLI's own session record, keyed by a hash of the source path), the memoized CLI versions, and the Antigravity status-line marker, which records the prior and the installed `statusLine.command`. See [Cursor semantics and the stamp sidecar](#cursor-semantics-and-the-stamp-sidecar).
- **A transient payload file.** `hooks/usage-capture.sh` and `hooks/antigravity-statusline-shim.sh` hand the payload the CLI gave them to Node through a temporary file in the system temp directory, and delete it once Node returns. Neither script sets a trap, so a hook killed during that call can leave the file behind. The file holds the CLI's hook payload verbatim, which can carry conversation text: the CLIs' own hook documentation, checked on 2026-09-24, lists the model request and response in Gemini CLI's `AfterModel` payload (`llm_request`, `llm_response`) and the turn's last assistant text in Claude Code's `Stop` payload (`last_assistant_message`). The non-interactive wrapper `scripts/lib/usage-headless.sh` stages the whole output of a run wrapped by `usage_headless_run` in a temporary file the same way, also without a trap, and that file can hold the model's reply text. `usage_headless_agy_rewrite_json_response` stages no reply: it rewrites the caller's own output file in place.
- **What adapters copy into `raw`.** Each interactive adapter copies only the key paths its table in [Per-adapter field sources](#per-adapter-field-sources) enumerates, never message content. The headless envelope adapter also copies only an allow-listed subset of the envelope (see [Headless envelope](#headless-envelope-run-total-all-clis)), never the reply text or tool input the envelope carries.

Retention, who can read each location, and removal are stated once for the whole feature, in the [organization note](usage-organization.md).
