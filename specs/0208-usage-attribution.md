# Usage attribution — declaration channels, an attribution ledger, and per-fidelity rollups

## Intent

This specification attributes a usage record to the macro-task it served —
either a CrewRig multi-CLI ticket, named by its own task-handoff key, or an
external work-tracking asset such as a forge issue, a Jira ticket, or a
shared file — so that a person or a downstream tool asking "what was this
session, this agent, or this whole reporting period doing" gets an answer
that holds regardless of which of the four CLIs produced the record or which
session carried it, can correct a wrong or a missing answer after the fact
without touching the record that answer describes, and can read a rollup for
a task or an asset that never collapses a coarse cumulative snapshot into the
same sum as a set of fine-grained per-request counts, nor silently drops the
records a source could never read at all.

## Requirements

1. Every usage record's attribution SHALL resolve, offline and within the
   capture step's own non-blocking contract, from exactly one of four
   ordered declaration channels, evaluated in this order: the current
   session's own declaration record, when its declaring channel names an
   explicit human declaration; the `CREWRIG_TASK` environment variable; the
   current working directory's own worktree path or checked-out branch
   name, when either matches the framework's own ticket-worktree or
   ticket-branch naming convention; that same declaration record, when its
   declaring channel instead names the framework's own session-start
   protocol. A record for which none of the four channels yields a
   candidate value SHALL carry no attribution, recorded as unattributed.
2. A session's declaration record SHALL be written or replaced by exactly
   one command this specification's implementation provides, held under the
   same root override the storage contract already reads (spec 0207's
   `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT`). Each write SHALL state what the record holds — a
   task-handoff key and/or an external asset being declared, the declaring
   channel that produced this write, and the instant of the write — without
   constraining the record's own on-disk format beyond that. A later write
   to a session's declaration record SHALL replace the earlier one in full,
   never merge with it.
3. The framework's own session-start protocol, whenever it establishes or
   resumes a task-handoff drawer for the current session, SHALL invoke
   requirement 2's command, before any task work in the session begins, to
   write that session's declaration record naming the established drawer's
   own task-handoff key and a declaring channel of the session-start
   protocol. A session whose session-start protocol establishes or resumes
   no task-handoff drawer SHALL leave requirement 1's fourth channel without
   a candidate value. Because this write always precedes any task work in
   the session, an explicit human declaration requirement 2's command
   records afterward SHALL replace it and SHALL resolve at requirement 1's
   first channel from that point onward, regardless of this earlier write.
4. The organization-facing documentation for the framework's session-start
   protocol — `~/.crewrig/system-context/long-running-task-convention.md`
   and `artifacts/core/rules/60-tools.md`'s Memory Activation Protocol —
   SHALL name requirement 3's recording step as part of establishing or
   resuming a task-handoff drawer.
5. Resolution SHALL evaluate the four channels in the fixed order of
   requirement 1 and SHALL stop at the first channel that is present — one
   that supplies a candidate value at all, whether or not that value
   ultimately validates. A channel ranked lower than the first present
   channel SHALL NOT be consulted, regardless of whether the first present
   channel's own candidate value passes or fails validation.
6. When the first present channel's candidate value passes its own kind's
   syntactic validation, that value SHALL become the record's attribution;
   when it fails, the record SHALL carry no attribution, recorded as
   unattributed together with the failing channel's name and the validation
   failure, and no repaired, normalized-beyond-pattern, or guessed
   replacement value SHALL be substituted for it.
7. The declaration channel that produced a record's attribution, or that
   produced its unattributed outcome together with a validation failure,
   SHALL be durably recorded for that record, inspectable without
   recomputation, without amending the usage-record schema (spec 0205) or
   its `attribution` block's fixed field set.
8. The worktree-or-branch channel, when it is the first present channel and
   its candidate value validates, SHALL populate a task-handoff key from the
   ticket identifier the matched worktree path or branch name carries. It
   SHALL additionally populate a `forge-issue` external asset from that same
   ticket identifier and one repository's owner-and-repository pair,
   entirely offline, chosen by this fixed rule, evaluated in order: the
   remote the checked-out branch's own configured upstream tracks; when the
   branch carries no upstream, the remote named `origin`. When the chosen
   remote resolves to no recognized forge host (GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea),
   or when neither rule step yields a configured remote, this channel SHALL
   yield the task-handoff key alone, together with a stated reason naming
   which rule step found no qualifying remote.
9. A task-handoff key or an external asset reference that this
   specification's channels populate for the same macro task SHALL be
   textually identical wherever that macro task is being worked from, across
   every CLI and every session, so that the storage contract's own retrieval
   by task-handoff key and by external asset reference (spec 0207
   requirement 15) returns every record belonging to that macro task without
   any further reconciliation step at read time.
10. A declared or derived external asset reference SHALL match one of the
    syntactic forms spec 0205's own kind registry defines: a forge issue as
    an owner-and-repository pair followed by an issue number, a Jira key, or
    a shared file path or URL; a reference matching none of the registered
    kinds' forms SHALL be treated as a validation failure under requirement
    6, never accepted under an invented or unregistered kind.
11. Validating a declared or derived external asset reference, or a declared
    or derived task-handoff key, SHALL check only that value's own syntactic
    shape and SHALL perform no network call, forge query, or other online
    check to confirm the referenced asset or task exists; resolving an
    asset's title, state, or other live metadata is out of scope of this
    specification's validation.
12. This specification SHALL introduce no new `attribution.externalAsset.kind`
    value beyond the registry spec 0205 already defines; a future kind
    remains an additive registry change under that specification, not this
    one.
13. The implementation realizing this specification SHALL provide an
    append-only attribution ledger, held beside the journal under the same
    root override the storage contract already reads (spec 0207's
    `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT`), distinct from the journal and from the usage-record
    schema.
14. Every ledger entry SHALL map exactly one of a session identifier, an
    agent identifier together with that agent's parent session, or a
    period, to a task-handoff key, an external asset reference, or both, and
    SHALL carry the entry's own timestamp, its author, and a stated reason.
15. A read that returns records or a rollup for a session, an agent, or a
    period carrying a matching ledger entry SHALL apply that ledger entry's
    task-handoff key or external asset reference in place of whatever
    attribution, if any, the underlying records themselves carry; a session,
    an agent, or a period carrying no matching ledger entry SHALL be read
    exactly as its underlying records' own attribution states, unattributed
    included.
16. Writing a ledger entry SHALL NOT mutate, correct, or otherwise alter any
    usage record; the `corrects` field spec 0205 defines on a usage record
    SHALL remain reserved for a measurement correction and SHALL NOT be used
    to express a retroactive attribution change.
17. An explicit prune of a period, as the storage contract's own prune
    command already performs (spec 0207 requirements 18 through 20), SHALL
    remove both the journal entries for that period and the attribution
    ledger's own entries recorded within that same period, together, leaving
    neither behind on its own.
18. The implementation realizing this specification SHALL provide one
    command that appends a new attribution-ledger entry and one command that
    lists the ledger's existing entries, filterable at least by the session,
    the agent and parent session, or the period an entry names.
19. This specification SHALL introduce no audit log, history table, or
    diagnostic trail for a retroactive attribution decision beyond the
    ledger's own append-only, timestamped, authored sequence of entries; the
    ledger itself SHALL constitute the complete audit trail for every such
    decision.
20. A rollup for a task-handoff key or for an external asset reference SHALL
    report its measurements grouped by fidelity, always: the sum of every
    `per-request` record's token counts, the sum of every `run-total`
    record's token counts, and, for `session-cumulative` records, the sum
    across sessions of each session's own last snapshot — never a sum across
    more than one snapshot from the same session.
21. A rollup MAY additionally report one combined total across more than one
    fidelity only when that total carries an explicit marker naming every
    fidelity it combines; a rollup reporting its per-fidelity sums alone
    SHALL carry no such marker, and no combined total SHALL be presented
    without one.
22. A rollup SHALL NOT derive a per-request-equivalent or any other delta
    value from two or more `session-cumulative` snapshots of the same
    session; each session's own last snapshot SHALL stand as that session's
    entire contribution to the rollup.
23. A rollup for a task-handoff key or an external asset reference SHALL
    combine every record attributed to that key or reference regardless of
    which of the four CLIs, which session, or which top-level or subordinate
    agent produced it.
24. A rollup SHALL report, separately from every token-count sum, the count
    of `uncaptured` records attributed to the task or the asset; that count
    SHALL NOT be folded into, or represented as a placeholder value within,
    any token-count sum. A task or an asset carrying zero `uncaptured`
    records SHALL report that count as zero, never omit it.
25. A continuous-integration suite SHALL verify, over a fixture exercising
    every declaration channel, that each channel wins its record's
    attribution when every higher-precedence channel is absent, and that a
    malformed candidate value at the first present channel yields an
    unattributed outcome naming that channel and the failure, with no
    lower-precedence channel consulted.
26. A continuous-integration suite SHALL verify, over a fixture holding both
    a capture-time attribution and a ledger entry for the same session, that
    a read applies the ledger entry's attribution in place of the
    capture-time one, and that the underlying record itself is unchanged by
    that read.
27. A continuous-integration suite SHALL verify, over a fixture mixing
    `per-request`, `run-total`, and `session-cumulative` records — including
    more than one `session-cumulative` snapshot for one session and at least
    one `uncaptured` record — attributed to one task-handoff key, that the
    rollup's per-fidelity sums, its `session-cumulative` last-snapshot
    handling, its marked combined total when requested, and its separate
    `uncaptured` count all match the fixture's own expected values.
28. A continuous-integration suite SHALL verify that the attribution ledger
    and the rollup commands operate under a root directory relocated through
    the same override the storage contract already reads (spec 0207's
    `CREWRIG_USAGE_ROOT`), producing no ledger entry or rollup result outside
    that relocated root.
29. A continuous-integration suite SHALL verify, over a fixture spanning at
    least two CLIs and two sessions — including one subordinate agent —
    attributed to one task-handoff key and one external asset, that every
    record's attribution for that macro task is textually identical across
    the fixture, and that a rollup for that task-handoff key combines every
    one of those records' measurements under that one key.
30. The organization-facing documentation for this specification SHALL name
    what a task-handoff key or an external asset reference reveals when read
    beside the identifiers a usage record and a ledger entry already carry,
    and SHALL extend spec 0207's own purge instructions to name how the
    attribution ledger, and the per-record channel diagnostic requirement 7
    introduces, are purged alongside the journal and its mirror.

## Scenarios

**Scenario:** Explicit declaration outranks every other channel

```text
Given a session carrying an explicit in-session declaration of a
      task-handoff key, alongside a CREWRIG_TASK environment variable naming
      a different key
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record's attribution carries the explicitly declared key, and the
      recorded channel names the explicit declaration, never the
      environment variable
```

**Scenario:** An explicit declaration made later in the session overrides an earlier session-start-protocol record

```text
Given a session whose session-start protocol recorded a declaration naming
      one task-handoff key before any task work began, and a human later
      issuing an explicit declaration naming a different task-handoff key
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session after the
      explicit declaration
Then  the record's attribution carries the explicitly declared key, and the
      recorded channel names the explicit declaration, never the
      session-start protocol
```

**Scenario:** CREWRIG_TASK wins when no explicit declaration was made

```text
Given a session carrying no explicit declaration, a CREWRIG_TASK
      environment variable naming a task-handoff key, and a working
      directory whose branch name also matches the ticket-branch naming
      convention
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record's attribution carries the CREWRIG_TASK key, and the
      recorded channel names the environment variable, never the branch
```

**Scenario:** Worktree-or-branch channel derives a task key and a forge issue together

```text
Given a session with no explicit declaration and no CREWRIG_TASK variable,
      whose working directory is checked out on a branch matching the
      ticket-branch naming convention, in a repository whose configured
      forge remote resolves to a recognized forge host
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record's attribution carries the branch-derived task-handoff key
      and a forge-issue external asset built from that same ticket
      identifier and the remote's own owner-and-repository pair, resolved
      entirely offline
```

**Scenario:** Two clones with different remote sets derive the same forge-issue asset

```text
Given two clones of the same repository, each checked out on the same
      ticket-branch-convention-matching branch — one clone configured with
      only an origin remote pointing at the repository, the other
      configured with crewrig, hcross, and origin remotes, whose checked-out
      branch's own upstream tracks the crewrig remote, and whose crewrig and
      origin remotes both point at that same repository while hcross points
      at a different one
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for a session in each clone
Then  both records carry a textually identical forge-issue external asset
      naming that one repository's owner-and-repository pair — the first
      clone's derived from its origin remote, the second clone's derived
      from its upstream-tracked crewrig remote
```

**Scenario:** No qualifying remote yields the task-handoff key alone

```text
Given a working directory checked out on a branch matching the
      ticket-branch naming convention, whose branch carries no configured
      upstream and whose repository configures no remote named origin
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record's attribution carries the branch-derived task-handoff key
      alone, no forge-issue external asset, and a stated reason naming that
      neither rule step found a qualifying remote
```

**Scenario:** The session-start-protocol-recorded key wins when the three higher channels are absent

```text
Given a session with no explicit declaration, no CREWRIG_TASK variable, and
      a working directory matching no ticket-worktree or ticket-branch
      naming convention, whose session-start protocol has nonetheless
      established or resumed a task-handoff drawer and recorded that
      drawer's own task-handoff key as its declaration
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record's attribution carries the key named in that declaration,
      and the recorded channel names the session-start protocol
```

**Scenario:** The session-start-protocol-recorded key wins when the branch name only resembles a ticket identifier

```text
Given a session with no explicit declaration and no CREWRIG_TASK variable,
      whose working directory is checked out on a branch whose name
      contains digits resembling a ticket identifier but does not match the
      framework's own ticket-branch naming convention, and whose
      session-start protocol has established or resumed a task-handoff
      drawer naming a different task-handoff key
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record's attribution carries the session-start-protocol-recorded
      key, never a value read from the branch name, and the recorded
      channel names the session-start protocol
```

**Scenario:** With no declaration record and no CREWRIG_TASK, resolution falls to the branch-derived ticket id

```text
Given a session whose session-start protocol established or resumed no
      task-handoff drawer, carrying no explicit declaration and no
      CREWRIG_TASK variable, whose working directory is checked out on a
      branch matching the ticket-branch naming convention
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record's attribution carries the branch-derived task-handoff key,
      and the recorded channel names the worktree-or-branch channel
```

**Scenario:** No channel resolves and the record is unattributed

```text
Given a session with no explicit declaration, no CREWRIG_TASK variable, a
      working directory matching no ticket-worktree or ticket-branch naming
      convention, and whose session-start protocol established or resumed
      no task-handoff drawer
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record carries no attribution, and the outcome is recorded as
      unattributed with no channel named
```

**Scenario:** A malformed declared value falls to unattributed without a fallback

```text
Given a session carrying an explicit in-session declaration whose value
      matches none of spec 0205's registered external-asset syntactic
      forms, alongside a CREWRIG_TASK environment variable naming a
      syntactically valid task-handoff key
When  a usage record's attribution resolves for that session
Then  the record carries no attribution, the outcome is recorded as
      unattributed naming the explicit-declaration channel and the
      validation failure, and the CREWRIG_TASK variable is never consulted
```

**Scenario:** A ledger entry overrides capture-time attribution at read time

```text
Given a usage record already written with a capture-time task-handoff key,
      and a later attribution-ledger entry mapping that record's session to
      a different task-handoff key, timestamped after the record's own
      capture instant
When  the record is read
Then  the read reports the ledger entry's task-handoff key in place of the
      record's own capture-time key, and the underlying journal entry
      remains exactly as it was written
```

**Scenario:** Pruning a period removes its ledger entries together with its journal entries

```text
Given a period holding both journal entries and attribution-ledger entries
      recorded within that period
When  an explicit prune is requested for that period
Then  the journal entries and the ledger entries recorded in that period are
      both removed, and neither is left behind on its own
```

**Scenario:** A mixed-fidelity rollup carries an explicit marker on its combined total

```text
Given one task-handoff key attributed to `per-request` records from one CLI
      and `session-cumulative` records from another
When  a rollup for that task-handoff key is read with a combined total
      requested
Then  the rollup reports the `per-request` sum and the `session-cumulative`
      sum separately, and its combined total carries a marker naming both
      fidelities it combines
```

**Scenario:** Multiple session-cumulative snapshots of one session are never summed

```text
Given one session that produced three `session-cumulative` snapshots at
      increasing cumulative token counts, all attributed to one
      task-handoff key
When  a rollup for that task-handoff key is read
Then  the rollup's `session-cumulative` contribution equals the session's
      last snapshot alone, and no delta or per-request-equivalent value is
      derived from the earlier snapshots
```

**Scenario:** Uncaptured records are counted separately from token sums

```text
Given a task-handoff key attributed to two `captured` records and one
      `uncaptured` record
When  a rollup for that task-handoff key is read
Then  the rollup's token-count sums reflect only the two captured records,
      and the rollup separately reports a count of one `uncaptured` record
```

**Scenario:** Two CLIs, two sessions, and one subagent combine under one task-handoff key

```text
Given three usage records for one macro task — one a Claude Code session's
      own record, one a Gemini CLI session's own record, and one a
      subordinate agent's record parented to a third session — each
      independently resolving its own attribution to the textually
      identical task-handoff key for that macro task
When  a rollup for that task-handoff key is read
Then  the rollup combines the measurements of all three records under that
      one key, each contributing to its own fidelity's sum
```

## Out of scope

- Pricing computation and any monetary value attached to an attributed
  record — seam (e), issue #1172.
- The dashboard and tracked-asset navigation surface, and any online
  resolution of an external asset's title, state, or other live metadata —
  seam (f), issue #1173.
- Any change to MemPalace itself, its retention policy, or its own
  wing-and-drawer conventions.
- Cross-machine aggregation of a rollup — a rollup reads one journal and one
  attribution ledger under one storage root; combining rollups produced on
  separate machines is not addressed here.
- Capture and its per-CLI triggers, and the shape of a captured or
  uncaptured record itself — seam (b), issue #1169 (spec 0206); this
  specification registers no new CLI hook event (spec 0206 requirement 14
  remains the sole trigger-registration boundary) and defines no new field
  on the usage-record schema. The declaration command requirement 2
  introduces, and its invocation from the session-start protocol under
  requirement 3, are this specification's own scope and are not a capture
  trigger.
- Storage backends, write mechanics, and the retention and prune mechanics
  themselves — seam (c), issue #1170 (spec 0207); this specification reuses
  that contract's root override and prune semantics without redefining
  them.
- Any new `attribution.externalAsset.kind` value — the registry stays
  exactly the one spec 0205 already defines (requirement 12).
- Amending the usage-record schema itself. Spec 0205's schema
  (`schemas/usage-record/v1.schema.json`) closes its `attribution` block to
  exactly `taskHandoffKey` and `externalAsset`, and its own versioning rule
  reserves any new version for a new sibling schema file, never an in-place
  edit; the declaration channel a record's attribution resolved through is
  therefore recorded alongside the record (requirement 7), never inside it.

## Open questions

(none)

## Attribution outcomes and ledger entries (informative)

This section is informative and non-normative — illustrative shapes for the
implementation, not a constraint any requirement above depends on.

### Declaration channel labels

| Label | Channel | Resolves |
|---|---|---|
| `explicit` | Declaration record, declaring channel: explicit human declaration | Task-handoff key and/or external asset, as declared |
| `env` | `CREWRIG_TASK` environment variable | Task-handoff key and/or external asset, as declared |
| `worktree` | Worktree path or branch name | Task-handoff key, plus a forge-issue external asset when a qualifying forge remote resolves |
| `protocol` | Declaration record, declaring channel: session-start protocol | Task-handoff key only |
| `unattributed` | No channel resolved, or the first present channel's value failed validation | Neither |

### Declaration record shape

```json
{
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "declaringChannel": "explicit",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T10:00:00Z"
}
```

One declaration record exists per session. `declaringChannel` names either
`explicit` (written by a human, directly) or `protocol` (written by the
framework's own session-start protocol, from a task-handoff drawer's own
`handoff_key`). A later write, of either kind, replaces the record in full.
`externalAsset` MAY stand alongside or in place of `taskHandoffKey`, in the
same shape spec 0205 already defines for a usage record's own
`attribution.externalAsset`.

### Ledger entry shape

```json
{
  "scope": { "session": "…" },
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T10:00:00Z",
  "author": "hcross",
  "reason": "spec-authoring session for #1171 ran on a spec/0208 branch"
}
```

`scope` names exactly one of `session`, `{ "agent": "…", "parent": "…" }`, or
`period`. `externalAsset` MAY stand alongside or in place of
`taskHandoffKey`, in the same shape spec 0205 already defines for a usage
record's own `attribution.externalAsset`.

### Rollup output shape

```json
{
  "taskHandoffKey": "1171",
  "byFidelity": {
    "per-request": { "netInput": 12000, "cacheRead": 3000, "cacheWrite": 500, "output": 4000, "reasoning": 800 },
    "session-cumulative": { "netInput": 9000, "cacheRead": 0, "cacheWrite": 0, "output": 2500, "reasoning": 0 }
  },
  "combined": { "netInput": 21000, "cacheRead": 3000, "cacheWrite": 500, "output": 6500, "reasoning": 800, "mixed": ["per-request", "session-cumulative"] },
  "uncapturedCount": 1
}
```
