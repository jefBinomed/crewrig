# CrewRig

CrewRig is a centralized configuration framework for
[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli),
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code),
[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli), and
[Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google).
It serves three complementary
purposes:

- **Personal context layer** — layered configuration files shape how AI
  assistants behave for a specific user's role, team, and seniority.
- **Shared artifact zones** — `artifacts/` is the single-source zone where
  skills, agents, and commands are authored once and compiled into outputs
  for all supported CLIs; an agent source declares what its work needs from a model as a **capability profile** ([spec 0195](specs/0195-agent-capability-profile.md)) rather than naming one — see [`docs/model-mapping-format.md`](docs/model-mapping-format.md) for what each CLI resolves it to.
- **Harness engineering** — a built-in feedback loop lets agents tag
  frictions encountered during real work; the harness curator clusters
  those frictions into actionable GitHub issues, closing the loop
  between AI behavior and continuous improvement.

CrewRig develops itself using its own mechanics. The internal agent crew
— architect, developer, tester, pr-logbook, and pr-reviewer — runs on
the same skills and agents that ship with the framework. The development
workflow is the product in action.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Config Target | Setup Command |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `~/.gemini/` | `task setup-gemini-interactive` |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) | `~/.claude/rules/` | `task setup-claude-interactive` |
| [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli) | Split: `.github/copilot/` + `.github/skills/` + `.github/agents/` (workspace-level) | `task setup-copilot-interactive` |
| [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google) | `~/.gemini/config/` | `task setup-antigravity-interactive` |

All platforms share the same source configuration files in `config/` and
`artifacts/`. Setup and build scripts deploy them into the
platform-specific directories. See `docs/cli-matrix.md` for the full
per-CLI integration matrix.

## How It Works

### Layered Context

Configuration files are organized by priority. Each file addresses a
specific concern (identity, policies, expertise, etc.) and they combine
to form the agent's full context:

| Priority | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 00 | `config/SOUL.md` | Agent identity and values |
| 10 | `config/level/<LEVEL>.md` | Seniority-adapted guidance |
| 20 | `config/ORGANIZATION.md` | Company-wide policies |
| 30 | `config/PROFILE.md` | Personal information |
| 40 | `config/expertise/<ROLE>.md` | Technical specialization |
| 50 | `config/teams/<TEAM>.md` | Team practices and norms |
| 60 | `artifacts/core/rules/60-tools.md` | Memory architecture and core tool rules |
| 65 | `config/TOOLS.md` | Organization-specific tool guidelines |

**Gemini CLI** loads these via numeric-prefix files in `~/.gemini/` with
enforced priority order. **Claude Code** loads them from `~/.claude/rules/`
as additive context (all files combine, no override). **GitHub Copilot CLI**
loads them from `~/.copilot/instructions/` as `*.instructions.md` files,
applied to all sessions. **Antigravity CLI** loads them from
`~/.gemini/config/AGENTS.md`.

### Artifact Zone

`artifacts/` is the single-source zone where skills, agents, and commands
are written **once** and compiled into outputs for all CLIs. Contributors
edit a single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter; the build step produces
Gemini CLI, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Antigravity CLI targets.

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Skill | Reusable agent behavior activated via `/skill-name` |
| Command | Slash command with a prompt body |
| Agent | Sub-agent with a dedicated persona |
| Hook | Lifecycle hook (BeforeTool/AfterTool/etc.) |
| Policy | Security or behavioral constraint |
| MCP Server | External tool integration |
| Theme | UI theme fragment |

Install a component on a project:

```bash
# Gemini CLI
task install-component TYPE=skills NAME=my-skill

# Claude Code
task install-claude-component TYPE=claude-skills NAME=my-skill
```

See [`artifacts/FORMAT.md`](artifacts/FORMAT.md) for the
full unified-source specification.

### Harness Engineering Loop

The harness turns real-world frictions into shipped improvements through
a four-stage loop:

1. **Tag** — during real work, agents invoke the `harness-report` skill
   the moment a friction signal fires (user pushback, tool surprise,
   process gap). Each tag lands in the MemPalace `harness-friction`
   wing.
2. **Cluster** — `task harness-curate -- --apply` clusters the tagged
   frictions by subcategory and opens one descriptive GitHub issue per
   cluster.
3. **Fix** — issues are addressed via the normal branch/PR workflow;
   the internal agent crew handles the implementation cycle.
4. **Re-install** — after a fix ships, run `task build-components` and
   reinstall. The `metadata.provenance.version` bump in every modified
   `SKILL.md` signals that a new version is available.

For automated periodic sweeps,
`artifacts/library/skills/harness-curator/scripts/schedule-curator.sh`
installs a macOS launchd job or a Linux crontab entry that runs the
curator on a fixed cadence.

### Security: Copy by Default

Context files are **copied** (not symlinked) to the target directory by
default. This prevents context poisoning from malicious branches. Symlink
mode is available for development only (with a security disclaimer).

### Memory Architecture

The framework implements a three-tier memory model:

| Tier | System | Role | Access |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | Sequential Thinking | Working memory (ephemeral) | Session only |
| 2 | MemPalace | Agent memory (persistent) | Read/write, cross-tool |
| 3 | Obsidian | User knowledge (Second Brain) | Read free, write user-controlled |

See `config/TOOLS.md` for the full memory protocol.

#### Multi-agent concurrency: ChromaDB and MCP daemons

When multiple CLI sessions (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Antigravity
CLI) or parallel agents access MemPalace simultaneously, two independent
layers each need a single owner, or writes corrupt.

![Two-layer memory coordination topology: the four CLIs connect through the shared MCP daemon (port 41893, one writer lease), which connects through the shared ChromaDB daemon (port 8001, one HNSW compactor), which owns the palace.](docs/assets/mempalace-mcp/topology.png)

**Tier 1 — the ChromaDB daemon.** Each `PersistentClient` instance spawns
its own Rust HNSW compactor. Concurrent compactors write to the same binary
vector index files without coordination, silently corrupting the HNSW
segment — searches return empty results while the SQLite layer remains
intact. CrewRig solves this by running a single shared `chroma run` daemon
that owns the `PersistentClient`. Every CLI session connects through
`scripts/lib/mempalace-http-wrapper.py`, which monkey-patches
`chromadb.PersistentClient` → `chromadb.HttpClient` before importing
MemPalace. See
[`docs/runbooks/chroma-http-server.md`](docs/runbooks/chroma-http-server.md)
for start/stop/status commands, log locations, migration steps, and
troubleshooting. The architectural decision is recorded in
[ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-chromadb-http-server.md).

**Tier 2 — the shared MemPalace MCP daemon.** Collapsing tier 1 does not, on
its own, collapse the palace *writer lease*: each CLI session still ran its
own stdio MemPalace process, and the first one to mutate held that lease for
the rest of its life, refusing every sibling session with MCP error
`-32001` (*"Peer MCP writer active"*). Converting a machine to a single
supervised MCP HTTP daemon that every CLI registers against —
`task mempalace:switch-http` — removes that contention between sibling
sessions by construction. Every CrewRig setup run defaults a machine to this
arrangement: setup probes the daemon, installs and starts it, and registers
the HTTP entry without a prompt (spec 0113 delta-02); `task
mempalace:switch-http` remains the machine-wide all-or-nothing converger for
machines set up before that change or where one CLI's setup failed. See
[the runbook](docs/runbooks/mempalace-mcp-server.md) for the conversion
command, daily operations, and the token-replacement procedure, and
[ADR 0016](docs/adr/0016-shared-mempalace-mcp-http-server.md) for the
decision record.

## Adopting CrewRig

Organizations that wish to adopt CrewRig without contributing upstream should
follow the **[Adoption Guide](docs/adoption-guide.md)** — a step-by-step
walkthrough covering fork initialization, overlay configuration, build
pipeline, CLI deployment, and upstream synchronization. The guide covers all
four supported CLIs (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI,
Antigravity CLI) and is the primary onboarding surface for adopting
organizations.

## Lifecycle Scenario

A complete journey, from installing the framework to closing the
harness loop:

1. **Install** — fork crewrig, then run
   `task setup-claude-interactive` (or `task setup-gemini-interactive`).
   Generate your profile with `/init-personal-profile` and your soul
   with `/init-soul`.
2. **Create** — add a `SKILL.md` to
   `artifacts/community/skills/my-skill/`, or run
   `task create-extension NAME=my-skill`. Run `task build-components`
   to generate outputs for both CLIs.
3. **Use on another project** — install the component:
   `task install-claude-component TYPE=claude-skills NAME=my-skill`.
   The skill is now available in Claude Code on that project.
4. **Record frictions** — as agents use the skill, they invoke the
   `harness-report` skill the moment a recognition signal fires. Each
   friction tag lands in the MemPalace `harness-friction` wing.
5. **Transform frictions into tickets** — run
   `task harness-curate -- --apply`. The curator clusters the
   frictions and opens one GitHub issue per cluster against the
   target repo.
6. **Implement** — address the issues via feature branches. The
   internal agent crew (architect → developer → tester → pr-logbook →
   pr-reviewer) handles the cycle.
7. **Install the new version** — run `task build-components` and
   reinstall; `metadata.provenance.version` bumps confirm which
   components changed.
8. **Back to step 3** — use the improved skill on your projects; the
   harness loop continues.

## Quick Start

### Gemini CLI

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crewrig/crewrig.git
cd crewrig

# Generate your personal profile
gemini "/init-personal-profile"

# Customize the agent identity
gemini "/init-soul"

# Run the interactive setup (deploys to ~/.gemini/)
task setup-gemini-interactive
```

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crewrig/crewrig.git
cd crewrig

# Generate your personal profile
claude /init-personal-profile

# Customize the agent identity
claude /init-soul

# Run the interactive setup (deploys to ~/.claude/rules/)
task setup-claude-interactive
```

### Copilot CLI

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crewrig/crewrig.git
cd crewrig

# Generate your personal profile
copilot -i "/init-personal-profile"

# Customize the agent identity
copilot -i "/init-soul"

# Run the interactive setup (deploys to ~/.copilot/)
task setup-copilot-interactive
```

### Antigravity CLI

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crewrig/crewrig.git
cd crewrig

# --new-project anchors the session to this clone — without it, on a machine
# with other Antigravity projects, agy resolves against whichever project was
# last active instead of the current directory.

# Generate your personal profile
agy -i "/init-personal-profile" --new-project

# Customize the agent identity
agy -i "/init-soul" --new-project

# Run the interactive setup (deploys to ~/.gemini/config/)
task setup-antigravity-interactive
```

### What happens step by step

1. **`/init-personal-profile`** walks you through an interview to
   generate `config/PROFILE.md` with your identity, tooling preferences,
   projects, and working philosophy.
2. **`/init-soul`** lets you customize the agent's personality by
   refining the `config/SOUL.md` template section by section.
3. **`task setup-*-interactive`** copies shared configuration files to
   the target directory, then prompts you to select your **team**,
   **expertise**, and **experience level** via an interactive menu with
   live preview.

### Artifact Zone (optional)

The `artifacts/` directory is the single-source zone for lightweight,
prompt-based components. Single-source files generate outputs for all
supported CLIs:

**Gemini CLI:**

```bash
task install-workspace
task install-component TYPE=skills NAME=my-skill
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
task install-claude-workspace
task install-claude-component TYPE=claude-skills NAME=my-skill
```

**Build from source:**

```bash
task build-components           # Both tools
task build-components-gemini    # Gemini only
task build-components-claude    # Claude Code only
task check-components           # Drift detection (CI)
```

### Extensions (optional)

Extensions are code-based capabilities (TypeScript MCP servers) packaged
as independent npm modules. From a single `extension.json` manifest, the
shared render produces the tool-native form for all four supported
command-line tools (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI,
Antigravity CLI):

**All CLIs (umbrella installer):**

```bash
task install-deps
task install-extension-all EXT=hello-world
```

**Gemini CLI:**

```bash
task install-deps
task install-gemini-extensions
task install-gemini-extension EXT=hello-world
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
task install-deps
task build-claude-plugin EXT=hello-world
task install-claude-plugin EXT=hello-world
```

See [Extension authoring](docs/extension-authoring.md) for the authoring
model, `extensions/core/hello-world/` for a complete example,
`extension-skeleton/EXTENSION-FORMAT.md` for the manifest specification,
and `extension-skeleton/` as a starting template.

## MCP Servers

### Gemini CLI (`config/gemini/settings.json`)

- **MemPalace** — Unified agent memory (replaces KG Memory + Deep Memory).
- **Sequential Thinking** — Working memory for structured reasoning.

### Claude Code (`~/.claude.json`, managed by `claude mcp add`)

Claude Code reads MCP servers from `~/.claude.json`, not from any `mcp.json`
file. The `setup-claude-interactive.sh` script registers them via
`claude mcp add --scope user`. To inspect or manage them later:

```bash
claude mcp list                      # Show registered servers
claude mcp add --scope user <name> -- <command> [args...]
claude mcp remove <name>
```

- **Sequential Thinking** — Working memory; registered as user-scope.
- **MemPalace** — Persistent agent memory; registered as user-scope (the
  setup script auto-detects the right Python interpreter and verifies the
  installed version is within the supported range `>=3.6.0,<3.7`). Install
  or upgrade with `task install-mempalace` (or
  `pipx install --force 'mempalace>=3.6.0,<3.7'`).
- **GitHub** — Available via Claude Code's built-in connectors.
