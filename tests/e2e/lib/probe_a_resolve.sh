# tests/e2e/lib/probe_a_resolve.sh — probe A (05-copilot-model-routing)
# verdict resolver. Pure function, no I/O, no env-var preconditions —
# sourceable in isolation by scripts/tests/test-e2e-probes.sh with synthetic
# leg results (spec 0194 R9; PLAN v2 comment 5506614582 step 2's truth table,
# step 6's mutation-resistance requirement, and finding v2-F1).

#
#   Each argument is the literal string "true" or "false". Echoes
#   "<verdict>|<reason-or-empty>" on stdout. Rows are tried in order; the
#   first match wins, and the order IS the contract:
#
#   Provenance of the *_nonce_observed inputs (issue #1107 fix 1): as of
#   spec 0194's hardening, these booleans are transcript-derived — the
#   caller (tests/e2e/scenarios/05-copilot-model-routing/run.sh) computes
#   them from tests/e2e/lib/probe_spawn_markers.sh's
#   nonce_in_spawn_result, not from grepping leg.txt (which the
#   orchestrating session can forge — see that module's header for the
#   live reproduction). This function's contract, truth table and body are
#   unchanged; only what the caller feeds it got harder to fake.

#
#   v2-F1: an efficacy-leg nonce absence is corroborating evidence the
#   `model:` hint is live ONLY when backed by one of the documented symptom
#   strings (docs/cli-matrix.md's "[GAP] Copilot CLI subagent model routing
#   on BYOK/Ollama" bullet, row 4). An uncorroborated absence — a
#   transient timeout, quota exhaustion, a nondeterministic prose reply — is
#   not evidence, and used to fall straight through to row 3/4 (`BUG-ABSENT`
#   reachable on an uncorroborated silence). The row above closes that gap.
#
# Verdict vocabulary: BUG-PRESENT | BUG-ABSENT | INDETERMINATE (spec 0194 R9).
