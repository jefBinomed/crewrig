# User Validate

The one skill every workflow invokes when it needs a **user-gate validation**
of an artifact — a spec, a plan, or any document. It is the sole implementation
of the backend-configurable gate protocol (spec 0080 R9): lifecycle stages and
external workflows call `user-validate` rather than open-coding a gate, so the
backend choice, the fallback rule, and the three cross-cutting options live in
exactly one place.

The skill is a **pure one-shot function**: one invocation, one of three
outcomes, control returned to the caller. It never loops, never auto-re-prompts,
and never decides what to do with a non-approval — that is the caller's policy.

## Invocation contract

Per invocation (spec 0080 R10):

- **Inputs:**
  1. the **artifact or element** to validate — a file path (preferred, e.g.
     `specs/0080-….md`) or an inline element the caller wants arbitrated;
  2. the **precise ask** — the one decision the user is being asked to make
     (e.g. *"Approve this plan for DEV?"*).
- **Output:** exactly one structured outcome:
  - `approved` — proceed;
  - `changes-requested` — do not proceed; carries a `feedback` string routed to
    the upstream stage for revision;
  - `rejected` — do not proceed; the situation is surfaced to the user and
    control returns to the caller.

The skill does **not** re-prompt on `rejected`. A `dismissed` decision, a
non-zero exit, or malformed output all collapse to `rejected` (see *Decision
mapping*); the caller re-drives under its own mode-specific retry / halt / page
policy (this closes spec 0080 OQ3 — no in-skill loop).

## Configuration discovery

Read the active configuration from **`~/.crewrig/validation.conf`** — a
per-user, machine-local file written by the `setup-*-interactive.sh` scripts,
outside the core layer (spec 0080 R15/R16). Format is `key=value`, one per line;
ignore blank lines and lines beginning with `#`. Keys:

| Key | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `internal` \| `plannotator` | `internal` |
| `translate` | `on` \| `off` | `off` |
| `pedagogy` | `simple` \| `contextual` \| `professor` | `contextual` |
| `illustration` | `on` \| `off` | `off` |

**If the file is absent, or a key is missing, use the default** — most
importantly `backend=internal`. Never fail the gate because the config file is
missing; the `internal` backend is the guaranteed floor on every CLI.

## Backend: `plannotator` (opt-in, rich review)

1. **Presence check (spec 0080 R4).** Run `plannotator --version`. If it fails
   (binary absent from PATH), **fall back to the `internal` backend for this
   gate AND tell the user** the fallback happened. Do not error out.

2. **Bespoke presentation generation (spec 0189 R1/R5).**
   - When **any** cross-cutting presentation preference is active (`translate=on`
     with non-English preferred language, `pedagogy != simple` such as
     `contextual` or `professor`, `illustration=on`, or custom `theme`), the
     skill SHALL construct a bespoke presentation document (typically a temporary
     HTML file in `/tmp/gate-presentation-*.html`) embodying the active language
     translation, pedagogical context, theme styling, and embedded image assets,
     and pass that file to `plannotator`.
   - Raw passthrough of the repository source file directly to `plannotator` is
     permitted **only** when all cross-cutting enhancements are disabled
     (`translate=off`, `pedagogy=simple`, `illustration=off`, default theme).

3. **Invoke exactly (spec 0080 R6, spec 0189 R1):**

   ```sh
   plannotator annotate <presentation-or-artifact-file> --gate --json
   ```

   Pass the presentation file (or raw artifact file on clean passthrough) as a
   file argument. Run it **detached**, not foreground — human review can far
   exceed a synchronous tool-call budget:

   - **Claude Code (verified).** Launch with the Bash tool
     `run_in_background: true` and consume the re-invocation the harness delivers
     when the process exits. **Never** use a foreground `sleep` to wait (it is
     blocked); when you need to wait on a condition, use the `Monitor` tool with
     an until-loop.
   - **Gemini CLI / Copilot CLI / Antigravity CLI (pending-DEV).** A detach +
     wait-between-polls primitive is not yet verified on these CLIs. Confirm one
     is available at gate time; **if none is feasible, degrade to the `internal`
     backend** and inform the user (same fallback path as R4).

4. **Dual validation (spec 0080 R7).** Treat the decision as complete **only
   when BOTH** the process exit status is `0` **AND** stdout carries a valid
   gate JSON object. A non-zero exit OR absent/malformed stdout is a
   non-approval — do not guess.

5. **Decision mapping (spec 0080 R8).**

   | Observed | Outcome |
   |---|---|
   | exit `0` + `{"decision":"approved"}` | `approved` |
   | exit `0` + `{"decision":"annotated","feedback":"…"}` | `changes-requested`, carrying `feedback` to the upstream stage |
   | `{"decision":"dismissed"}`, OR non-zero exit, OR absent/malformed stdout | `rejected` — surface the situation, return to caller |

### Contrast-safety and theme support for caller-built presentations

**Scope (spec 0099 R2, spec 0174 R6).** This guidance applies **only** when you
build a bespoke HTML presentation of the artifact before handing it to the
review viewer — for example because an active `pedagogy`, `translate`, or
`illustration` option obliges a richer rendering than the raw file. It does
**not** apply when you pass a raw Markdown or plain-text artifact file straight
through (spec 0099 R2/R8, spec 0174 R6): on that passthrough path the viewer's
own renderer owns readability, and you MUST NOT inject inline contrast styling.

**Why (spec 0099 R3, spec 0174).** The review viewer renders the document body
but does **not** reliably honor a `<head>`-scoped `<style>` block. Colors
declared only in `<head>` can surface as unreadable low-contrast content — such
as black-text-on-black-background in dark viewers. Furthermore, users work in
both light and dark desktop environments; presentations must adapt to their
system theme preference or honor explicit theme configuration in
`~/.crewrig/validation.conf` without sacrificing contrast.

**Rules for a caller-built HTML presentation:**

- **Discover the active theme (spec 0174 R1/R2).** Discover `theme` from
  `~/.crewrig/validation.conf` (`auto|system|dark|light`, default: `auto`).
- **Declare appropriate color-scheme metadata (spec 0174 R3, supersedes spec
  0099 R6).**
  - When `theme=auto` (or `system`), declare `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">`.
  - When `theme=dark`, declare `<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark only">` (or `dark`).
  - When `theme=light`, declare `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light only">` (or `light`).
- **Inline or body-scope every readability-critical declaration (spec 0099 R4/R5, spec 0174 R4/R5).**
  Each color, background, and contrast declaration SHALL be self-contained
  inline on the content wrapper and `<body>`, or defined via body-scoped CSS
  custom properties inside `<body><style>`. Never place critical styles in
  `<head>`.
- **Adaptive styling for `auto` / `system` mode (spec 0174 R4).** Define CSS
  variables on `:root` within a `<body><style>` block with a `@media
  (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` override, ensuring WCAG AA contrast for text,
  backgrounds, cards, and diff excerpts across both light and dark modes.

**Compliant examples (spec 0174 R7):**

*1. Adaptive template (`theme=auto`, recommended default):*

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
  </head>
  <body style="margin:0; padding:1.5rem; background:#ffffff; color:#111111;">
    <style>
      :root {
        --bg: #ffffff;
        --card-bg: #f6f8fa;
        --text: #111111;
        --border: #d0d7de;
      }
      @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        :root {
          --bg: #0d1117;
          --card-bg: #161b22;
          --text: #e6edf3;
          --border: #30363d;
        }
      }
      body { background: var(--bg) !important; color: var(--text) !important; }
      .card { background: var(--card-bg); border: 1px solid var(--border); }
    </style>
    <main class="card" style="padding:1.5rem; border-radius:8px;">
      <h1>Decision title</h1>
      <p>Artifact content…</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

*2. Explicit dark template (`theme=dark`):*

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="color-scheme" content="dark only">
  </head>
  <body style="margin:0; padding:1.5rem; background:#0d1117; color:#e6edf3;">
    <main style="background:#161b22; color:#e6edf3; border:1px solid #30363d; border-radius:8px; padding:1.5rem;">
      <h1 style="color:#e6edf3;">Decision title</h1>
      <p style="color:#e6edf3;">Artifact content…</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

*3. Explicit light template (`theme=light`):*

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="color-scheme" content="light only">
  </head>
  <body style="margin:0; padding:1.5rem; background:#ffffff; color:#111111;">
    <main style="background:#f6f8fa; color:#111111; border:1px solid #d0d7de; border-radius:8px; padding:1.5rem;">
      <h1 style="color:#111111;">Decision title</h1>
      <p style="color:#111111;">Artifact content…</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Substance-embedding for caller-built presentations

**Scope (spec 0104 R2).** This guidance applies **only** when you build a
bespoke presentation of the artifact before handing it to the review viewer —
for example because an active `pedagogy`, `translate`, or `illustration` option
obliges a richer rendering than the raw file. It does **not** apply on the raw-
passthrough path (see the *Raw passthrough* rule below): there the viewer's own
renderer already displays the full artifact.

**Why (spec 0104 R3/R4).** A caller-built presentation that only *describes* the
change — a title, a one-line summary, and the prior reviewer's verdict — leaves
the reviewing user unable to judge what is actually being decided. That is the
summary-only merge-authorization outcome observed during a live gate:
translation and professor-level pedagogy were active, yet the user never saw the
modified content itself. "Professor" framing means *showing the work*, not
narrating it.

**Rules for a caller-built presentation:**

- **Embed the real substance (spec 0104 R3, spec 0189 R2).** When
  `pedagogy=professor` and/or `translate=on`, the presentation SHALL embed the
  **concrete changed content itself** — a rendered diff excerpt, or the added or
  changed prose verbatim — alongside pedagogical context and decision implications,
  not only a prose summary describing what changed.
- **Show enough of a change set to judge it independently (spec 0104 R4).** For
  a decision over a change set or diff — a merge-authorization gate, for
  instance — show enough of the actual modified content for the reviewing user
  to judge the change **independently**, rather than relying solely on a prior
  REVIEW verdict.
- **Translate the embedded substance, presentation-only (spec 0104 R5, spec 0189 R3).** When
  `translate=on`, translate the embedded substance itself within the
  presentation, consistent with the `translate` boundary (see *Cross-cutting
  options → `translate`*): the translation is presentation-only and the
  repository artifact stays in English — never written back translated
  (`AGENTS.md` → *Language*).
- **Raw passthrough boundary (spec 0104 R6, spec 0189 R5).** When no translation,
  custom pedagogy levels (`pedagogy=simple`), or illustrations are configured,
  raw artifact passthrough to the validator remains supported without requiring
  a bespoke intermediate presentation document.

**Presentation-only (spec 0104 R7, spec 0189 R3).** This obligation does **not**
modify the invocation command, the dual-validation rule, the decision mapping,
or the defined semantics of the `translate` / `pedagogy` / `illustration`
cross-cutting options; it clarifies how a caller-built presentation applies them.

**Compliant vs thin example (spec 0104 R4).** A compliant merge-authorization
presentation embeds the real change; a thin one summarizes it away:

```text
Compliant — embeds the substance:
  Ask: "Authorize merge of PR #123?"
  Change under decision (added prose, verbatim):
    + The guidance SHALL direct showing enough of the actual modified
    + content for the reviewing user to judge the change independently.
  Prior REVIEW verdict: APPROVE — context, not a substitute for the diff.

Thin — non-compliant:
  Ask: "Authorize merge of PR #123?"
  Summary: "Adds substance-embedding guidance; reviewer approved."
  (no diff, no changed prose — the user cannot judge the change itself)
```

## Backend: `internal` (default floor)

Realise the gate through **`AskUserQuestion`** (or the host CLI's equivalent
structured interactive prompt) — **never as a prose question**. This preserves
and does not weaken
`specs/0037-validation-gate-must-use-askuserquestion.md`.

The `internal` feature set is a deliberate subset of `plannotator`:

- Present the precise ask as a structured question whose options map to the
  three outcomes — e.g. *Approve* → `approved`, *Request changes* →
  `changes-requested` (then collect the feedback text), *Reject* → `rejected`.
- Apply `translate` and `pedagogy` framing (below) to the question and option
  text.
- `illustration` is **not** honoured here (see R14) — there is no browser image
  surface on the `internal` path.

**Structured-equivalent (non-Claude CLIs).** `AskUserQuestion` is verified on
Claude Code. A structured interactive-prompt equivalent is verified on Gemini
and Copilot (using `ask_user`) and on Antigravity (using `ask_question`). The
gate realizes the structured question without downgrading to prose.

## Cross-cutting options

### `translate` (spec 0080 R12, spec 0189 R3)

When `translate=on` and the user's preferred language is not English, translate
**only the transient gate presentation** shown to the user — the artifact copy
displayed, the contextual commentary, the question, and the option text. The
**repository artifact stays in English**; never write a translated copy back to
the repo (`AGENTS.md` → *Language*). Translation is presentation-only.

### `pedagogy` (spec 0080 R13, spec 0189 R1/R2)

Frame each validation request per the level:

- **`simple`** — brief context plus the user's role in this decision.
- **`contextual`** (default) — the global context, the concerned part, and the
  precise ask.
- **`professor`** — a full pedagogical re-explanation of the arbitration
  situation (what is being decided, why, what each choice implies) alongside
  complete substance embedding.

### `illustration` (spec 0080 R14, spec 0189 R4, spec 0189 delta-01 R6/R7)

Honoured **only when `backend=plannotator` AND a browser image surface is
available** — otherwise **silently ignored** (no error, no note). Because
Plannotator renders the artifact as HTML in a browser it launches itself, image
display is a function of browser availability, not of the driving CLI (uniform
across all four CLIs, not a per-CLI asymmetry — spec 0080 OQ4). When honoured,
generation is **best-effort** via the `nano-banana` skill; if it is unavailable
or fails, proceed with the gate without the illustration.

**Pedagogical value requirement (never decorative, spec 0189 delta-01 R6).**
Generated images or graphical assets in validation presentation documents SHALL
be reserved strictly for pedagogical benefit (such as explaining architectural
schemas, component boundaries, sequence flows, or decision trade-offs).
Generating purely decorative illustrations is prohibited as an unnecessary
expense and distraction.

**Inline SVG preference for diagrams (spec 0189 delta-01 R7).** When schematic
diagrams or structural visualizations are needed in a presentation document,
authors SHALL prefer self-contained inline SVG markup over AI-generated raster
images.

**Inline Base64 Data URI Requirement (spec 0189 R4).** When illustrations or
local image assets are referenced in an HTML presentation document passed to
`plannotator`, all image data SHALL be encoded and embedded as self-contained
inline base64 data URIs (`data:image/png;base64,...` or
`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`) rather than local file system path URIs
(`file://`). Modern web browser security sandboxes block loading `file://` URIs
from rendered pages, causing local images to fail to display unless inlined as
data URIs.

### `theme` (spec 0174 R1/R2)

Tune the presentation styling when building a bespoke HTML document for
`plannotator`:

- **`auto`** (or **`system`**, default) — adaptive styling using body-scoped CSS
  custom properties and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` to automatically
  match the user's OS theme in both light and dark modes with WCAG AA contrast.
- **`dark`** — forces explicit dark theme styling (`<meta name="color-scheme"
  content="dark only">`, dark background, light text).
- **`light`** — forces explicit light theme styling (`<meta name="color-scheme"
  content="light only">`, light background, dark text).

## Parity posture (spec 0080 R3/R17)

| CLI | `plannotator` detached invocation | `internal` structured prompt | Guaranteed floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | verified | `AskUserQuestion` (verified) | `internal` |
| Gemini CLI | verified | `[GAP-confirmation]` | `internal` |
| Copilot CLI | verified | `[GAP-confirmation]` | `internal` |
| Antigravity CLI | verified | `[GAP-confirmation]` | `internal` |

The `internal` backend is the floor on every CLI: whenever a richer affordance
cannot be proven available at gate time, degrade to `internal` rather than
assert an unverified capability. See `docs/cli-matrix.md` rows 27 / 27b.

## Harness friction tagging

When a recognition signal fires (see `config/TOOLS.md` → *Friction Reporting →
Recognition signals*), invoke the `harness-report` skill
(`artifacts/library/skills/harness-report/SKILL.md`) rather than reimplementing
the protocol inline. Tagging is fire-and-forget; do not block the gate waiting
for an acknowledgment.
