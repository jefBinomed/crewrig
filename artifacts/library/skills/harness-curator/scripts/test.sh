# `m.tool_update_drawer` works because apply.py's `main()` binds those two
# names as module globals (`global tool_get_drawer, tool_update_drawer`
# right before the function-local import) — `_stamp_drawer` resolves them
# from the module's global namespace at call time, so a test-time
# assignment on `m` is visible to it without ever running `main()`.
