# Unified Community Component Format

This document specifies the single-source format for community components
in `artifacts/community/`. Components written in this format are compiled by
`scripts/build-components.sh` into tool-specific outputs for Gemini CLI
and Claude Code.

## Principles

1. **One source file, multiple targets** — the prompt/logic content is
   written once and shared across all tools.
2. **Universal metadata** is required — `name`, `description`, `type`.
3. **Tool-specific overrides** are optional — only needed when a tool
   requires metadata beyond the universal fields.
4. **The body is never duplicated** — install scripts extract the body
   and wrap it in the target tool's format.

## Supported Component Types

| Type | Source location | Gemini CLI output | Claude Code output |
|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| `skill` | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `command` | `commands/<name>.md` | `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `agent` | `agents/<name>/AGENT.md` | `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` |

This table shows the two outputs common to every component kind; each kind
also compiles to GitHub Copilot CLI (`.github/skills/…` or `.github/agents/…`)
and Antigravity CLI (`.agents/skills/…` or `.agents/agents/…`). Neither Copilot
nor Antigravity has a first-class slash-command file format, so `command`
sources compile to a wrapper skill on both — four build outputs in total, not
two. The full four-surface breakdown for `command` is in
[Build Outputs](#build-outputs) below.

Hooks, policies, and MCP servers use JSON formats and are handled
separately by the build script (merged into tool-specific config files).

## Source File Format

Every source file uses Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
# === Universal metadata (required) ===
name: my-component
description: "Brief description used for discovery and activation"
type: skill           # skill | command | agent

# === Gemini CLI overrides (optional) ===
# Only include if Gemini needs different metadata than the universal fields.
# Omit entirely to use universal defaults.
gemini:
  # No extra fields needed for most skills.
  # For commands: no overrides needed (description + body used as-is).

# === Claude Code overrides (optional) ===
# Only include if Claude Code needs extra metadata.
# Omit entirely to use universal defaults.
claude:
  allowed-tools:
    - Read
    - Write
    - Edit
    - Bash
    - Grep
    - Glob
  user-invocable: true
  # disable-model-invocation: false  # default

## Field Reference

### Universal Fields (required)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Component identifier (kebab-case) |
| `description` | string | Brief description for discovery. Used by both tools. |
| `type` | string | `skill`, `command`, or `agent` |
| `metadata` | mapping | Optional container recognized by the agentskills.io spec for non-standard keys. crewrig curates `metadata.provenance` here (see [Provenance & Forks](#provenance--forks)). |

### Gemini CLI Overrides (optional)

The `gemini:` section is rarely needed. The build script uses universal
fields by default:

- For `skill`: generates a SKILL.md with `name` and `description` in
  the frontmatter, body as-is.
- For `command`: generates a `.toml` file with `description` and the
  body wrapped in `prompt = """..."""`.
- For `agent`: generates a flat `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` file with YAML
  frontmatter (`name`, `description`) — required by Gemini CLI's
  sub-agent discovery — followed by the body as the system prompt.

### Claude Code Overrides (optional)

The `claude:` section adds Claude Code-specific frontmatter fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `allowed-tools` | string[] | *(none)* | Tools the skill can use |
| `user-invocable` | boolean | `true` | Can the user invoke with `/name`? |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | `false` | Prevent auto-invocation? |
| `context` | string | *(none)* | Run context (`fork` for isolated subagent) |
| `agent` | string | *(none)* | Agent type (`Explore`, `Plan`, etc.) |

**`model` and `effort` are native Claude Code per-agent frontmatter keys, not
`claude:`-section fields an agent source authors.** A compiled Claude Code
agent output's `model:` and `effort:` frontmatter, when present, is written
by a model-mapping resolution (spec 0198) directing a source's capability
profile onto that surface — never by a source declaring
`claude.model` or `claude.effort` under its `claude:` section. A
source-authored `claude.model` or `claude.effort` is read by no build step
(spec 0200 requirement 26). The two keys stay recorded here, and not
deleted, because `model-mappings/claude.yml` grounds both of its
frontmatter items on a citation of this record.

### `metadata.model:` (optional, agent sources only)

An **agent** source (`type: agent`) MAY declare a CLI-agnostic **capability
profile** under `metadata.model:`, sibling of `metadata.provenance:` (spec
0195). It states what the agent's work needs from a model — never a
concrete model, vendor, or CLI-namespaced key — and is optional: a source
carrying no `metadata.model:` mapping, or one that declares no axis and no
tuning knob, keeps exactly the behavior it has today (session-model
inheritance). Skills and commands do not carry this field.

`metadata.model:` is the **only** surface on which an agent source
declares a model need — there is no other key, on any section, that
states one. On the upstream-owned tiers (`artifacts/core/` and
`artifacts/library/`), a source's `metadata:` block admits exactly two
keys, `provenance` and `model`; `scripts/check-component-metadata-keys.sh`
is the gate that rejects any other (spec 0200 requirement 8).

| Key | Type | Domain | Unconstrained state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `intelligence` | string | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `xxhigh`, `max` (ascending) | *(axis omitted — no model is selected)* |
| `reasoning` | string | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` (ascending) | *(axis omitted)* |
| `specialization` | string | open enum of kebab-case tokens | `general` |
| `context` | integer | a positive token count (a floor) | *(axis omitted)* |
| `speed` | string | `standard`, `fast` | `standard` |
| `modalities` | string[] | subset of `text`, `vision`, `image-out` | `[text]` (or an absent/empty list) |
| `locality` | string | `any`, `local-only` | `any` |
| `tuning` | mapping | the five keys below | *(mapping omitted or empty)* |

`tuning:` admits exactly:

| Key | Type | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| `temperature` | number | `0.0` to `2.0` inclusive |
| `top-p` | number | greater than `0.0`, at most `1.0` |
| `top-k` | integer | at least `1` |
| `max-output-tokens` | integer | at least `1` |
| `max-turns` | integer | at least `1` |

A key outside these eight, or a `tuning:` key outside these five, is
rejected at authoring time by `scripts/check-agent-profiles.sh` — a
hermetic check over the source and these domains alone, consulting no
mapping. A value outside a closed domain is rejected the same way; an
unenumerated `specialization` value is not, because that axis is an open
enum. The check never runs inside the build and its rejection never blocks
a build: a profile it rejects is still resolved against, the keys it
cannot read degrading rather than failing (spec 0198 R39).

The per-CLI mapping that turns a declared profile into a target's native
fields or prose lives in `model-mappings/<target>.yml`, normatively
described in [`docs/model-mapping-format.md`](../docs/model-mapping-format.md);
the resolution that reads a mapping and a profile together is
`scripts/lib/model-resolve.sh`, consumed by `scripts/build-components.sh`.
How an adopting organization changes what a mapping resolves to for its own
fork is documented in
[`docs/org-model-mapping-override.md`](../docs/org-model-mapping-override.md);
what the migration of the core agents and of the compiled Claude Code layout
asks of that organization is documented in
[`docs/agent-profile-migration.md`](../docs/agent-profile-migration.md).

**Obligation:** a later delta of spec 0195 that changes one of the domains
above SHALL update this section and `scripts/check-agent-profiles.sh` in
the same change — the same obligation
[`docs/model-mapping-format.md`](../docs/model-mapping-format.md) → *Domains*
already carries for the mapping side.

## Build Outputs

### Skill: `artifacts/core/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Gemini CLI → `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
---
<body>
```

Claude Code → `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
allowed-tools:        # from claude.allowed-tools (if present)
  - Read
  - Bash
user-invocable: true  # from claude.user-invocable (if present)
---
<body>
```

### Skill resource subfolders (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`)

Per the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification), a
skill may ship three optional resource subfolders alongside its
`SKILL.md`:

| Subfolder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/` | Executable code the skill invokes (Python, Bash, JavaScript). |
| `references/` | Additional documentation loaded on demand. |
| `assets/` | Templates, fixtures, static resources. |

When present in a source under `artifacts/core/skills/<name>/`,
these subfolders are **propagated verbatim** to both build outputs
(`.gemini/skills/<name>/<subfolder>/...` and
`.claude/skills/<name>/<subfolder>/...`). Executable bits are
preserved. Skill bodies should reference resources by path relative
to the skill root (e.g. `scripts/curate.sh`), so the same invocation
works regardless of whether the skill lives at project level
(`.gemini/.claude/`) or user level (`~/.gemini/`, `~/.claude/`).

### Command: `artifacts/<tier>/commands/<name>.md`

Gemini CLI → `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml`

```toml
description = "<description>"

prompt = """
<body>
"""
```

Claude Code → `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
user-invocable: true
allowed-tools:        # from claude.allowed-tools (if present)
  - Read
  - Bash
---
<body>
```

GitHub Copilot CLI → `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: "<description>"
allowed-tools:         # from claude.allowed-tools (if present)
  - Read
  - Bash
---
<body>
```

Antigravity CLI → `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: "<description>"
---
<body>
```

Neither Copilot nor Antigravity has a first-class slash-command file format,
so `build_commands` compiles a command source into a user-invocable skill on
both — the same fallback `build_skills` and `build_agents` already use for
their own Copilot and Antigravity outputs.

### Agent: `artifacts/core/agents/<name>/AGENT.md`

Gemini CLI → `.gemini/agents/<name>.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
metadata:          # propagated when source declares metadata.provenance
  provenance:
    canonical: ...
    feedback: ...
    version: ...
---
<body — becomes the agent's system prompt>
```

Claude Code → `.claude/agents/<name>.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
---
<body>
```

## Provenance & Forks

Components carry a `metadata.provenance:` block in their frontmatter that
survives forks and lets feedback flow back to the right repo. The block
is optional but recommended for any component intended to be re-shared.

`provenance` lives under `metadata:` to keep the root frontmatter
restricted to fields recognized by the
[agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
(`name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`,
`allowed-tools`). The spec reserves `metadata:` for non-standard keys —
crewrig curates `provenance` there.

```yaml
---
name: my-component
description: "..."
type: skill
metadata:
  provenance:
    canonical: "${CANONICAL_REPO}"   # origin (audit + license trace)
    feedback:  "${CANONICAL_REPO}"   # MR target — upstream-owned tier ⇒ canonical
    version:   "1.0.0"               # version at build/import
---
```

The `feedback` target is governed **per tier**, not by a single fork-wide
setting:

- **Upstream-owned tiers** (`artifacts/core`, `artifacts/library`,
  `extensions/core`, `extensions/library`) MUST declare `feedback` equal to
  `canonical` (`"${CANONICAL_REPO}"`). A fork never diverts feedback away from
  components it does not own — frictions on upstream components always reach the
  upstream repo, regardless of the fork's `feedback_repo`. The
  `scripts/check-feedback-routing.sh` CI guard enforces this (see
  `task check-feedback-routing`).
- **Adopter-owned tiers** (`artifacts/community`, `artifacts/org`,
  `extensions/org`) use `feedback: "${FEEDBACK_REPO}"`, so a fork's own
  components route feedback to the fork's configured `feedback_repo`.

### Placeholder resolution

`${SHELL_LIKE}` placeholders are resolved at **build time** by
`scripts/build-components.sh` from `crewrig.config.toml` at the repo
root. Each line in the config file maps an uppercased key to a value:

```toml
canonical_repo = "https://github.com/crewrig/crewrig"
feedback_repo  = "https://github.com/crewrig/crewrig"
```

The build substitutes every `${KEY}` placeholder it encounters in the
generated outputs (`.gemini/`, `.claude/`) — frontmatter **and** body —
not only inside the `metadata.provenance:` block. This is intentional:
components may reference `${CANONICAL_REPO}` or other config keys in
their prompt body too. Source files keep the placeholders untouched.

### Forking workflow

When you fork crewrig (or a fork of it):

1. Edit `crewrig.config.toml` to point at your URLs. Typically:
   - Keep `canonical_repo` pointing at the upstream you forked from
     (audit trail).
   - Set `feedback_repo` to your own repo so harness feedback lands
     internally.
2. Run `task build-components` to regenerate the outputs with your
   values.
3. Commit both `crewrig.config.toml` and the regenerated outputs.

`feedback_repo` governs **adopter-owned tiers only** (`artifacts/community`,
`artifacts/org`, `extensions/org`). It has **no effect** on upstream-owned
components (`artifacts/core`, `artifacts/library`, `extensions/core`,
`extensions/library`): those always route feedback to `canonical`, so
overriding `feedback_repo` does **not** capture feedback on components you did
not author — that feedback keeps flowing to the upstream repository where the
components are maintained. This is by design (spec 0030) and enforced by
`scripts/check-feedback-routing.sh`.

### Extension skills & agents — carrier-in-source, literal origin

The placeholder/build-strip model above applies to `artifacts/` components,
which are *built* into per-CLI outputs. A skill or agent shipped inside an
**extension** (`extensions/core`, `extensions/library`) is different: it is
consumed **in place** — `install-extension.sh` does `ln -s` / `cp -rf` of the
whole extension dir, and `build-claude-plugin.sh` does `cp -r` of the skill dir
— so every CLI reads the same `SKILL.md` / `AGENT.md` source bytes with **no
render seam** to strip a frontmatter block. Two consequences follow (spec 0043):

- **Carrier = HTML comment, first body line.** Because Gemini CLI 0.42.0+
  rejects any frontmatter key outside `name`/`description`, an in-place source
  cannot carry `metadata.provenance` in frontmatter. It is authored directly as
  the HTML-comment carrier (the same one `gemini_provenance_comment` emits for
  built Gemini agents) on the first body line, immediately after the
  frontmatter close:

  ```markdown
  ---
  name: greeter
  description: "…"
  ---
  <!-- crewrig-provenance: version="1.0.0" canonical="https://github.com/crewrig/crewrig" feedback="https://github.com/crewrig/crewrig" -->

  # Greeter Skill
  ```

- **`canonical`/`feedback` are LITERAL, not `${CANONICAL_REPO}`.** A consuming
  project's `crewrig.config.toml` cannot resolve a third-party extension's
  origin, so a build-time-resolved value would misroute frictions. The
  extension names its own origin as a literal URL (spec 0043 R2).

For an upstream-owned extension tier, `feedback` MUST equal `canonical` exactly
as for `artifacts/` (spec 0030). **Enforcement note:** because this block lives
in a *comment*, the frontmatter/`yq`-based `check-feedback-routing.sh` cannot
see it and permanently skips extension skills — so the presence and R5
(feedback==canonical) enforcement for extension skills/agents lives **solely**
in `scripts/check-extension-provenance.sh` (no defense-in-depth overlap with the
spec-0030 guard). See [`docs/cli-matrix.md`](../docs/cli-matrix.md) row 5c.

The `version:` field in `metadata.provenance:` is a literal
per-component string, not a placeholder. It tracks the component's own
evolution independently from the host repo.

### Version semantics (SemVer)

The `metadata.provenance.version` field follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
(`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

| Bump | When |
|---|---|
| **PATCH** (`1.0.0 → 1.0.1`) | Friction-driven fix or wording change. The skill's contract is unchanged; an agent following `1.0.0` and an agent following `1.0.1` produce equivalent output. Most curator-driven fixes are PATCH. |
| **MINOR** (`1.0.1 → 1.1.0`) | Additive change. New section, new recognition signal, new payload field, new optional behavior. Backward-compatible — agents following `1.0.x` keep working unchanged. |
| **MAJOR** (`1.1.0 → 2.0.0`) | Breaking contract change. Removed payload fields, renamed required fields, semantics flip. Forks pinning `1.x` need to migrate consciously. |

**Bump rule.** Every PR that touches a `SKILL.md`, `AGENT.md`, or
`commands/*.md` source under any artifact tier — `artifacts/core/`,
`artifacts/library/`, or `artifacts/community/` — MUST bump
`metadata.provenance.version` in the same diff. CI enforces this via
`scripts/check-skill-versions.sh` (see `task check-skill-versions` for
the local invocation). The same discipline extends to the upstream-owned extension tiers `extensions/core/` and
`extensions/library/`, where the `version` instead rides on the
provenance carrier (the first-body-line `<!-- crewrig-provenance:
version="…" … -->` HTML comment per spec 0043, not frontmatter — Gemini
CLI 0.42.0+ rejects non-`name`/`description` frontmatter keys on the
in-place source); there the bump is enforced by
`scripts/check-extension-version-bump.sh` (spec 0044). The
rationale:

- A friction tag captured `evidence: <path>:<line>` against an
  unspecified version drifts silently once the source changes. The
  version pins the contract observed at tag time.
- Forks that install at user level (`~/.gemini/`, `~/.claude/`) need
  a signal to re-pull. A version field with no bump = no signal.
- Maintainers triaging `harness-feedback` issues can compare the
  friction's observed version against the current canonical version
  and immediately see whether the friction has already been fixed.

The bump goes in the same PR as the change. A "version-only bump" PR
is not a thing — it always accompanies a content edit.

### Components without a `metadata.provenance:` block

Components shipped before the provenance contract existed (or
intentionally unscoped) build unchanged — the resolver only acts on
content that actually contains placeholders. There is no automatic
backfill.

## Parser Requirements

The build script (`scripts/build-components.sh`) requires:

- **`yq`** (preferred) for YAML frontmatter parsing, or a lightweight
  Python helper as fallback.
- **`jq`** for JSON merging (hooks, policies, MCP servers).
- **Bash 3.2.57** — the stock macOS `/bin/bash`, and the enforced floor. The
  forbidden constructs are declared in `ci/bash32-forbidden.txt` and rejected in
  continuous integration by `scripts/check-bash32-portability.sh`: no
  associative arrays (`declare -A`), no `mapfile`/`readarray`. This entry
  previously read "Bash 4+ for associative arrays", which contradicted that
  guard.

## Validation Rules

1. Every source file MUST have `name`, `description`, and `type` in
   the frontmatter.
2. The `type` field MUST be one of: `skill`, `command`, `agent`.
3. The body (content after the closing `---`) MUST NOT be empty.
4. Tool-specific sections (`gemini:`, `claude:`) are optional.
5. Unknown fields in tool-specific sections are silently ignored.
6. Two components MUST NOT be installed under the same name into the same
   landing zone. The build refuses such a pair before writing anything, naming
   the colliding name and every tier that declares it (spec 0119 R13). The
   bound is the landing zone, not the name: two components whose landing zones
   differ do not collide, however their names relate (R12).

   The contrast is worth stating, because both halves are load-bearing:

   - **Legal.** `architect` exists as both a skill and an agent. A skill lands
     in `.claude/skills/architect`, an agent in `.claude/agents/architect.md` —
     different landing zones, so the pair builds. Eight other name pairs in
     this repository are legal for the same reason. A `core` component may
     likewise share a name with an overlay one: `core` lands in the committed
     project tree, every overlay tier lands in the user home.
   - **Refused.** A *command* and a *skill* sharing one name. Three of the four
     supported CLIs have no first-class slash-command format and compile a
     command into the skills namespace — `.claude/skills/<name>`,
     `.github/skills/<name>`, `.agents/skills/<name>` — so the pair would claim
     one landing zone under one name. Two tiers declaring one `policies` name
     is refused on the same ground, even though nothing compiles a policy.

   The check keys on the installed target each component reaches, not on its
   source path, so it covers every type an install command can resolve —
   including `policies`, `hooks`, `themes` and `mcp-servers`, which no CLI
   compiles and which a guard scoped to build output could not reach.
